Plasticity Within the Obligatory Folding Nucleus of an Immunoglobulin-like Domain
A number of β-sandwich immunoglobulin-like domains have been shown to fold using a set of structurally equivalent residues that form a folding nucleus deep within the core of the protein. Formation of this nucleus is sufficient to establish the complex Greek key topology of the native state. These nucleating residues are highly conserved within the immunoglobulin superfamily, but are less well conserved in the fibronectin type III (fnIII) superfamily, where the requirement is simply to have four interacting hydrophobic residues. However, there are rare examples where this nucleation pattern is absent. In this study, we have investigated the folding of a novel member of the fnIII superfamily whose nucleus appears to lack one of the four buried hydrophobic residues. We show that the folding mechanism is unaltered, but the folding nucleus has moved within the hydrophobic core.
Introduction
Studies of structurally related proteins have clearly indicated that for
many proteins the folding mechanism is determined primarily by the native state
topology.1,2 This is evident from comparative Φ-value analyses of proteins
that share similar folds but are very different in sequence. Such studies
include representatives from all protein classes; all-α proteins,3–9 all-β proteins,10–22 and mixed α/β proteins.23–28 The folding mechanisms of these proteins range from purely
hierarchical, where secondary structural elements form before any tertiary
structure, to pure nucleation-condensation, where secondary and tertiary
structure form concomitantly.29 A study of representative members of the homeodomain superfamily
family has suggested that their folding mechanisms are dependent on inherent
secondary structural propensity, and the authors propose that all folding
mechanisms are in fact variations of the same theme:3 as the propensity for forming secondary structures decreases,
the folding mechanism shifts from pure hierarchical to polarized transition
states, and ultimately to the classical nucleation-condensation mechanism first
shown for CI2.30 Separate investigations have suggested that a folding nucleus
consists of obligatory and critical components: the specific interactions
necessary to establish the correct topology form first, followed by a subset of
surrounding residues that provide the critical stabilising
interactions.31–33
As part of the “fold approach” we have studied the folding of a number of
proteins with an Ig-like fold,16–18,34–36 all of which are composed of two anti-parallel β-sheets packed
against each other. The deep hydrophobic core is always formed from the packing
of the four central B, C, E and F β-strands,37 but the number and position of the edge strands varies between
the superfamilies.38 Although proteins in different superfamilies share the same
fold, they are apparently unrelated in sequence and are found in proteins with a
wide variety of functions. The stabilities of the Ig-like proteins studied to
date range from about 1 kcal mol− 1 to 9 kcal
mol− 1, and the folding rate
constants vary by six orders of magnitude. However, there is a correlation
between folding rate and thermodynamic stability, which suggests that the
interactions that are critical in stabilising the fold also govern the folding
process.34
All members of the fold studied to date fold via a
nucleation-condensation mechanism where the obligatory folding nucleus comprises
a set of structurally equivalent buried hydrophobic residues in the B, C, E and
F-strands that form a “ring” of interactions in the core (Figure 1). Early
packing of the residues, which are distant in sequence, ensures formation of the
correct native state topology.35,36 The critical nucleus surrounds this obligatory nucleus, but the
degree of structure formation varies between different proteins.
The residues that form the obligatory folding nucleus are highly conserved
within immunoglobulin domains but are conserved only in terms of residue type in
fibronectin type III (fnIII) domains. However, there are rare examples of
proteins that appear to have a disparate nucleation pattern. Here, we have
identified a fnIII domain in which one of the hydrophobic residues in the
conserved folding nucleus has been replaced by a surface polar residue, and we
ask how the folding mechanism has been affected. An extensive protein
engineering Φ-value analysis reveals that the folding mechanism is unaltered,
but that a spatially different set of core residues is used to form the
obligatory folding nucleus, where interactions within each sheet establish the
correct hydrogen bond registry between the core β-strands. Subsequent
interactions between two such pairs are able to bring the β-sheets together and
set up the complex Greek key topology.
Results
Residue conservation within the folding nucleus of fnIII
domains
A non-redundant multiple sequence alignment from Pfam was used to
analyse the residue conservation in the putative folding nucleus of fnIII
domains.39 These nucleation positions were identified through
comparison with the third fnIII domain from human tenascin (TNfn3), which
has been studied extensively in our laboratory. In most fnIII domains (73%),
all four residues in the proposed folding nucleus positions are hydrophobic.
Further analysis reveals that where there is a polar residue in one of these
folding positions, it is almost invariably in the C or E strand, and these
hydrophilic residues are usually arginine or lysine. These can act as
hydrophobic residues, since the long aliphatic side-chains can traverse the
core and allow the charged terminus to reside on the surface of the
protein.40 Small hydrophilic residues, such as asparagine or aspartate,
are found very rarely (only in ∼ 3% of all cases).
Most fnIII domains (65%) have a single aromatic residue in the proposed
folding nucleus. Analysis of the distribution of aromatic residues in the
four obligatory folding nucleus positions shows clearly that aromatic amino
acids are located preferably within the C–F sheet (Figure 2).
Furthermore, the type of aromatic residue present is affected by the solvent
accessibility of the β-strand: the C-strand position is partly
solvent-accessible, and hence the majority of aromatic residues occurring
within this strand are tyrosine (thereby allowing hydrogen bonding of the
hydroxyl group with solvent molecules). In contrast, the F-strand position
is deep within the core and phenylalanine is almost always the aromatic
residue of choice. Approximately 20% of the sequences have more than one
aromatic residue in the folding nucleus, and again these residues are almost
exclusively located in the C–F sheet (86% of all such sequences). This
asymmetry is likely caused by the presence of an adjacent conserved
tryptophan in the B-strand that is essential for stability but not involved
in the folding nucleus.16,18 Interestingly, about 15% of the fnIII domains appear to
fold without any aromatic residues at the supposed folding positions,
suggesting that a large side-chain is not crucial for the formation of the
obligatory nucleus.
Selection of CAfn2 as a candidate
All known fnIII structures were surveyed to find a candidate protein
that was missing a hydrophobic residue at one of the four putative folding
positions. Only one candidate protein was identified, the second fnIII
domain in chitin A1 from Bacillus circulans (CAfn2),
which has a surface-exposed asparagine in the putative nucleus position in
the C-strand. It has an aromatic residue in the F-strand folding position
(Phe66).41
In this work we intended to compare the folding of CAfn2 with TNfn3, as
this is the most extensively studied “typical” fnIII domain. The structure
of CAfn2 was superimposed on the structure of TNfn3 to reveal a RMSD of only
1.7 Å over all structurally equivalent positions (69 residues), even though
the two proteins have just 13% sequence identity (Supplementary Data Figure 1). The major differences are
restricted to the loops and turns, which are different in length in the two
proteins. CAfn2 has the same Greek key topology as all other fnIII domains,
(Figure 1), and possesses both
the highly conserved Trp residue in the B-strand and the conserved tyrosine
corner motif (Supplementary Figure
1).42 A comparison of the structures of CAfn2 and TNfn3 reveals
that the lengths of the highly conserved EF-loop and the AB-turn are
identical in these proteins, whereas the rest of the loops show some
variation. Most notably the C and C′-strands are shorter in CAfn2 and are
joined by a short tight turn (Figures 1 and
3). The packing
interactions are almost identical in the two proteins, with the majority of
the contacts being made within the same sheet, and the interactions between
sheets occurring in “layers”.18 To help visualize the interactions that occur within the
proteins, all residue positions are described according to both the β-strand
and the core layer in which they reside (Figure
3).
Importantly, however, inspection of the supposed obligatory folding
nucleus of CAfn2 clearly shows that the C-strand residue, N40, does not pack
against the other putative nucleus residues (Figure 1). How, therefore, does this domain
fold?
Characterization of wild-type CAfn2
The equilibrium stabilities of wild-type CAfn2 and all its mutant
proteins were determined through the use of standard denaturation curves fit
to a two-state equation.43 From a number of repeated measurements of wild-type CAfn2
the free energy of unfolding (ΔGD–N)
was estimated to be 6.7( ± 0.3) kcal
mol− 1 at pH 5.0 and 25 °C.
Kinetic studies reveal a single unfolding phase, but two refolding
phases. Since the slower phase accounts for less than 15% of the total
amplitude, and is apparently independent of the concentration of denaturant,
it was attributed to proline isomerisation. Both arms of the chevron plot
are linear (Figure
4), and the
βT for wild-type CAfn2 is estimated to be 0.56. This is
similar to that of TNfn3,44 indicating that the two transition state structures are of a
similar compactness.
Effect of mutations
Using the Φ-value analysis of TNfn3 as a basis, a total of 23
non-disruptive mutations were made throughout the CAfn2 protein. Where
possible, all mutations were conservative deletions.45 Contacts lost upon mutation are given in Table 1. The
difference in free energy between wild-type and mutant
(ΔΔGD–N) was calculated using an
average m-value,
<m>, of 1.15(± 0.02)
kcal mol− 1 M− 1. It has been shown that m-values are
hard to determine with accuracy (the range of
m-values observed is typical for that observed in
most large-scale protein engineering studies) so that use of an average
m-value reduces the error in
ΔΔG.46 Most mutations are destabilizing but
ΔΔGD–N values range between
− 1.5 kcal mol− 1
and + 6.0 kcal mol− 1.
Chevron plots for all mutants are shown in Figure 4, with the kinetic data given in Table 2.
Using these data, Φ-values were calculated from refolding data at 0 M
denaturant. Note that for three highly destabilized proteins (L22A, Y36L and
L58A) there were too few data points in the refolding arm to determine the
gradient (mkf) accurately. In these
cases an average mkf (1.06
M− 1) was used to fit the data.
Note that this has no effect on the final Φ-value determined at 0 M
denaturant. Only one mutant, V38A, has a folding
m-value that is significantly different from this
mean value.
Several mutant proteins exhibit roll-over in the unfolding arm, and
some mutants have increased mku
values. Such behavior in unfolding has several possible explanations. It has
been ascribed to “Hammond” behaviour, where there is a broad transition
state barrier,47 or to population of a high-energy intermediate.48 We do not have sufficient data to distinguish these two
possibilities and, since there is no roll-over in the wild-type protein, it
is not possible to determine Φ-values for the “late” transition state using
unfolding data. However, the model used has no effect on analysis of the
“early” transition state, at 0 M denaturant.49
Structure of the transition state
A number of positions in each β-strand of CAfn2 were probed using
Φ-value analysis. Φ is a measure of the extent of structure at a given
residue in the transition state (‡). A Φ-value of 1 indicates that the
interactions are fully formed in ‡, whereas a Φ-value of 0 indicates that
the structure is as unfolded in ‡ as in the denatured state. The precise
interpretation of fractional Φ-values is ambiguous but is usually taken to
mean that the residue is partly structured in ‡.50 However, it is generally accepted that, particularly when
comparing homologous proteins, the best approach is to look at patterns of
Φ-values rather than considering the absolute values of individual
residues.2
The CAfn2 Φ-values range from 0 to 0.5, indicating that none of the
positions analyzed is completely structured at the transition state
(Table 2). In general, the
Φ-values in the A and G-strands are close to 0, while those in the central
B, C, C′, E and F β-strands are higher, and the Φ-values in these central
strands are higher in the central layers of the core than at the extremes
(Figure 3), as observed in
TNfn3,18 the tenth fnIII domain of fibronectin (FNfn10)16 and the titin immunoglobulin domain TI I27.17 The Φ-values were classified into low (Φ ≤ 0.2), medium (0.2 < Φ < 0.4) and high (Φ ≥ 0.4)
classes. These Φ-values are mapped onto the CAfn2 structure in Figure 5.
A and G-strands
All mutations in the A and G-strands gave low Φ-values, indicating
very little structure formation in these strands in the transition state
(Table 2; Figures 3 and
4). Both mutated sites in the
A-strand, L10A(A3) and S12A(A2), pack onto the neighbouring B-strand,
whilst inter-sheet interactions are formed with residues from the F and
G-strands (Table 1). The
ΔΔGD–N for the S12A(A2)
mutation is too low for a reliable Φ-value to be determined. The three
residues probed in the G-strand, S81(G4), V84(G3) and V86(G2), make
interactions mainly with residues from the A and F-strands
(Table 1).
Strands B, C, E and F
All core positions in CAfn2 were mutated, with the exception of W24
in the B-strand. The distribution of Φ-values reveals that the
hydrophobic core is only partially formed in the transition state
(Table 2; Figures 3 and
4). The highest values occur
at positions V38(C4) and I55(E3), with moderate Φ-values at four other
positions: I20(B2), L22(B3), V68(F4) and A70(F5).
C′-strand
The C′-strand is connected by two short loops to the central C and
E-strands. Three of the four mutations within this strand, L44A(C′3),
T46A(C′4), and V48A(C′5), have high Φ-values (Table 2; Figures 3 and
4). T46 and V48 interact
mainly with the buried residues from the C and E-strands, whereas the
L44 contacts are limited to residues within the C and C′-strands
(Table 1).
Discussion
CAfn2 folds by a nucleation-condensation mechanism
There has been much discussion of folding mechanisms in recent years.
The two “extremes” are represented by the framework model, where local
secondary structure forms before tertiary structure, and
nucleation-condensation, where secondary structure and tertiary structure
form concomitantly. Such extremes have distinct patterns of Φ-values. In the
framework model, Φ-values will fall into two groups, one set close to 1 and
the other close to 0. This has been termed a polarised transition state. In
a nucleation-condensation mechanism, the transition state structure will be
more diffuse, involving most of the protein, and Φ-values will all be
generally between 1 and zero. Furthermore, in the nucleation condensation
mechanism, the pattern of Φ-values is generally distinctive, with a subset
of residues having slightly higher Φ-values, with Φ-values gradually
becoming lower as structure condenses around the early “nucleus”. The
pattern of Φ-values shows CAfn2 to have a diffuse nucleus, with two-thirds
of the residues having Φ-values between 0.10 and 0.45. Moreover, these are
arranged in the structure as one would predict from a
nucleation-condensation pattern, with higher Φ-values at the centre of the
core, becoming lower towards the edges of the molecule. This suggests
strongly that CAfn2 folds, as do other Ig-like proteins,
via a nucleation-condensation folding mechanism.
However, again like other Ig-like proteins, there is a significant number of
residues, in the peripheral A and G-strands, and in loops that have Φ-values
close to 0, suggesting that in the final stage of folding these peripheral
strands and loops pack onto the central region of the protein.
Identification of the obligate (embryonic) folding nucleus
Oliveberg and co-workers have suggested that residues that constitute
the transition state for folding in a nucleation-condensation mechanism
might be divided into two sets.31,32 The first set of residues make up the “embryonic” or
obligate folding nucleus, defined as the set of primary contacts that are
obliged to form to establish the topology of the protein. The second set is
the residues that pack onto this embryonic nucleus forming the “critical
contact layer”, providing sufficient interactions to drive the folding
process downhill. Note that residues that form the embryonic nucleus have to
form a network of contacts that establish the topology of the protein, but
that residues in the critical contact layer may contribute significantly
towards stabilising the transition state for folding. Identifying the most
likely obligate folding nucleus from a pattern of Φ-values is non-trivial,
especially for complex Greek key structures. This has been discussed in
detail.18 In summary, it is not possible simply to “pick” residues
with the highest Φ-values as being those that form the folding nucleus: one
also has to consider the packing of the residues. In TNfn3, as is observed
here for CAfn2, residues in the B-strand have generally low Φ-values
compared to the Φ-values in the other central β-strands. This does not
necessarily mean that the residues in the B-strand are less important for
folding. Residue L22(B3) in CAfn2, for example, forms about half of its
inter-strand contacts with residues in the A and G-strands, which have
Φ-values of ∼ 0. Thus, the contacts with the C (V38), E
(A53 and I55) and F (F66 and V68) strands must be more formed than the
moderate Φ-value would indicate. Similarly, the high Φ-values in the
C′-strand probably reflect the fact that the residues in this strand make
the vast majority of their tertiary contacts with residues in the C and
E-strands, which are themselves partially formed. In TNfn3 it was suggested
that this C′-strand is “obliged” to fold when the adjoining C and E-strands
pack together. Thus, we would now, following the nomenclature suggested by
the Oliveberg model, assign residues in the C′-strand to the critical
contact layer and not to the obligatory embryonic nucleus.
For TNfn3, the residues with the highest Φ-value in the B, C, E and
F-strands were initially chosen as putative nucleus residues. Examination of
the structure showed that these residues are all found in the same core
layer, and that they pack to form a “ring” of interactions in the core of
the protein. It was suggested that this “obligatory” nucleus alone was
sufficient to establish the topology of the native protein. This picture of
the folding transition state was confirmed by subsequent restrained
molecular dynamics simulations.36 A similar method has been used to identify the folding
nucleus in a structurally related immunoglobulin domain.17,35
Using the same strategy, the Φ-value pattern of CAfn2 was investigated
to identify the putative obligate folding nucleus, a set of residues with
significant Φ-values that interact such that these interactions are
sufficient to establish the topology of the protein. The layer that contains
residues with consistently high Φ-values in the B and E-strands is layer 3
(I55 and L22), as in TNfn3. However, for the C and F-strands, the layer with
the highest Φ-values is layer 4 (V38 and V68). Examination of the structure
of CAfn2 shows that although residues L22 and I55, and V38 and V68 sit in
different core layers, these four residues are still able to pack together
in the centre of the core to form a ring of contacts (Figure 6). We
suggest that the residues surrounding the obligate nucleus, residues in the
C′-strand and more peripheral residues in the B, C E and F-strands, pack
onto these obligate nucleus residues and, together, form the critical
contact layer required to stabilise the transition state structure
sufficiently to drive folding.
There is a caveat we should make. We note that in CAfn2 it is more
difficult to select which residues are likely to form part of the obligate
nucleus than it was in TNfn3. Consider the B-strand. I20(B2) exhibits a
Φ-value that is slightly lower, but is within error of L22(B3). However, I20
forms no contacts with the nucleating residues from the opposite sheet,
(V38(C4) and V68(E4)), suggesting that it does not form part of the
obligatory nucleus that establishes the topology of the molecule.
Furthermore, as was the case in TNfn3, we were unable to determine a Φ-value
for the highly conserved Trp in the position B4. Simulations confirmed for
TNfn3 that this Trp residue had a low Φ-value (as we had inferred from the
pattern of Φ-values surrounding the Trp residue). Trp 24 makes 150
side-chain–side-chain contacts in CAfn2, and 65% of these contacts are with
residues that have Φ-values that are (or are predicted to be) low (Φ ∼ 0.15, 52 contacts) or zero (46 contacts).
Less than one-third of the contacts made by Trp24 are with residues in the
putative obligatory nucleus (with L22, V38 and V68) and no contact is made
with I55. Thus, we tentatively propose that if Trp24 does have a role in the
folding nucleus, it is more likely to be in the critical layer than in the
topology-defining obligate nucleus. Also consider residue A70 in the
F-strand in position F5. The Φ-value for this residue is very slightly
higher than that for V68 in layer F4. However, Ala to Gly mutation must be
considered to be non-conservative and, furthermore, Ala70 makes no contact
within the proposed obligate nucleus i.e. it cannot have a role in
establishing the Greek key topology.
Comparison of the transition states of CAfn2 and TNfn3
The Φ-values for TNfn3 are generally higher than those in CAfn2,
ranging from 0 to 0.6;18 however, the pattern of Φ-values is similar. For both
proteins, the mutational results can be separated into two classes. The
first group consists of residues in the central β-strands, which show
significant formation of structure in the transition state. The second group
consists of mutations probing the terminal A and G-strands, and residues
from the extremities of the central strands. These two populations are
clearly observed in a Brønsted plot (Figure
7).
Nevertheless, there are important differences between the two domains,
which are apparent in the pattern of Φ-values (Figure 8). In the
C–F-sheet, the highest Φ-values in TNfn3 are found in core layer 3 (V70,
0.54; Y36, 0.53), with the Φ-values in layer 4 being significantly lower
(L72, 0.29; L34, 0.35). However, in CAfn2 the Φ-values in layer 3 are very
low (F66, 0.07; N40, 0.01), whereas the Φ-values in layer 4 (V68, 0.25; V38,
0.40) are significantly higher (Figures 3
and 8). This indicates that the absence of a buried
hydrophobic residue in position C3 has forced the obligate folding nucleus
of CAfn2 to “migrate down” one layer within the core (Figure 6). Perhaps unexpectedly, a
corresponding “downwards migration” has not occurred in the B–E-sheet; (even
if Trp24 was important, the Φ-value for A53(E4) is unambiguously low
(0.14)). Such migration is not necessary; analysis of the CAfn2 structure
shows clearly that residues L22(B3) and I55(E3) form significant
interactions with V68(F4) and V38(C4) in the opposite sheet. Thus, these
inter-sheet interactions would be sufficient to establish the Greek key
topology.
Further support for this migration hypothesis comes from Φ-values in
the EF-loop. TNfn3 exhibits moderate Φ-values in this loop, (Y68(F2), 0.42;
L62(E2), 0.33), which indicates that it is significantly structured in the
transition state. It was argued that this loop is “obliged” to be structured
in the transition state of TNfn3 to allow for formation of the adjacent
folding nucleus: the more distant BC-loop exhibits lower values. However, in
CAfn2 the folding nucleus has shifted away from the EF-loop (Figure 6) and consequently it is less
restrained within the transition state (Φ-values for Y64(F2) and L58(E2) are
0.04 and 0.16, respectively).
Both TNfn3 and CAfn2 display high Φ-values in the C′-strand. We suggest
that these residues are not involved in the obligatory folding nucleus, but
result from short CE-loops that force the C′-strand to pack as the nucleus
forms;18 thus, these residues form part of the critical contact
layer. In CD2d1, an immunoglobulin Ig variable domain, the nucleating C and
E-strands are joined by a much longer loop comprising three β-strands, C′,
Cʺ and D. In this case these strands do not pack until late in
folding.18,19
In summary, for both proteins we observe the formation of a specific
nucleus in the core of the protein involving formation of long-range
tertiary contacts between a single residue from each of the B, C, E and
F-strands. Formation of this “obligate” nucleus establishes the topology of
the protein. Other residues pack around this obligate nucleus to form the
critical contact layer until sufficient contacts have formed to surmount the
free-energy barrier. This is typical of a nucleation-condensation folding
mechanism. The peripheral strands and the loops pack late, mainly after the
rate-limiting step for folding.
Conclusion: plasticity within the obligatory folding nucleus
in Ig-like domains
Unlike other classes of proteins, such as the homeodomain proteins, all
Ig-like proteins appear to fold by the same, nucleation condensation
mechanism. The obligate nucleus is defined by the interactions that are
necessary to establish the complex Greek key β-sheet topology of the native
state. Previous biophysical studies of members of the Ig-like fold have
shown that this folding nucleus always comprises a ring of interacting
residues within the hydrophobic core: one residue from each of the B, C, E
and F-strands. Whereas the obligatory nucleus in the immunoglobulin
superfamily proteins is highly conserved and is based around the invariant
tryptophan located within the C-strand, members of the fnIII superfamily
show more variability. Instead of restricting a particular structural
position to a specific amino acid, each position simply needs to possess a
hydrophobic residue. Here, we have shown that the fnIII nucleus is more
flexible still, and that when this pattern of residue conservation is lost
upon mutation, fnIII proteins can “migrate” the folding nucleus, thereby
revealing plasticity in the early stages of the folding process, while
retaining the same folding mechanism.
Such plasticity in the folding of Ig-like proteins has been observed
previously; the Ig domain TI I27 has been shown to fold by alternative,
parallel pathways.51 Although the wild-type protein folds only through one
pathway under physiological conditions, extremes of temperature and
denaturant, or mutations within its obligate folding nucleus also result in
a switch of folding pathway. Lindberg and Oliveberg have suggested recently
that a “malleable” protein folding energy landscape will allow proteins to
retain efficient folding during the course of evolution, even though the
finer details of the folding pathway are dependent on individual
sequence.52 It is possible that the ability of these Ig-like domains to
alter their folding pathway on mutation has contributed to the success of
this fold, and has contributed to its abundance in the proteome (over
40,000 Ig-like domains are listed in the current Pfam database).
Materials and Methods
Protein expression and purification
The fibronectin type III domain used in this work consists of 88
residues (SwissProt P20533, residues 559–646, PDB 1K85) of the
Bacillus circulans chitinase A1. The synthetic
gene was produced using overlapping primers and standard PCR techniques, and
was inserted into a modified version of pRSETA vector (Invitrogen)
containing an N-terminal His-tag followed by a thrombin cleavage site.
Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange Kit
(Stratagene). The identity of wild-type and mutants was confirmed by DNA
sequencing.
Protein expression was carried out in Escherichia
coli C41 cells.53 Transformed cells were grown to an absorbance at 600 nm of
0.6 at 37 °C before induction with IPTG and growth overnight at 28 °C. The
cells were harvested and lysed by sonication. The soluble fraction was bound
to Ni2+-agarose resin, washed several times to remove
weakly bound proteins, and eluted from the Ni2+-agarose
resin in a high concentration of imidazole. After dialysis to remove the
imidazole, the proteins were cleaved overnight with thrombin. Uncleaved
protein and remaining His-tag were removed by using small amounts of
Ni2+-resin before further purification by
gel-filtration chromatography using a Pharmacia Biotech Superdex 75 column.
When not used immediately, proteins were flash-frozen and stored at − 80 °C.
Equilibrium measurements
The stability of the CAfn2 wild-type and mutant proteins was determined
by equilibrium urea denaturation in 50 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0
(15 mM HOAc, 35 mM NaOAc) at 25 °C. The solutions were left to equilibrate
at 25 °C for at least 2 h before measurements were recorded. All experiments
were carried out in thermostatted cuvettes at 25 °C. The experiments used an
excitation wavelength of 280 nm, and an emission wavelength of 360 nm. Data
were fit to an equation describing a two-state transition.43
Change of free energy on mutation
The change of free energy on mutation,
ΔΔGD–N, was determined using
equation (1):54Where [urea]50% is the concentration of urea
at which 50% of the protein is unfolded for wild-type (wt) and mutant (mut)
proteins, and <m> is the mean
m-value determined from all measurements on
wild-type and mutant proteins.
Kinetic measurements
All kinetic experiments were done using an Applied Photophysics
stopped-flow fluorimeter. The excitation wavelength was 280 nm and the
emission was monitored at wavelengths > 320 nm. All
experiments were carried out in 50 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0) at
25 °C. The final concentration of all proteins was 1 μM. Refolding rates at
0 M denaturant were determined using CAfn2 unfolded at pH 12.4 as
described.18 Between three and five traces were averaged for each
concentration of denaturant. The refolding data were fit to an equation
using a single-exponential term. An average refolding
m-value of 1.06 M− 1 was used for mutations L22A, Y36L and L58A. Fitting data to an
equation with two exponentials did not improve the residuals. The unfolding
data were fit to an equation describing a single-exponential process with
curvature.
Φ-Value analysis
The Φ-value for folding was determined using equation (2):54.where ΔΔGD–‡ is the
change in the difference in free energy between D and the transition state
(‡) upon mutation and calculated from refolding data as follows:where kf and
kf′ are refolding rate constants
for wild-type and mutant proteins (at 0 M urea), respectively.
