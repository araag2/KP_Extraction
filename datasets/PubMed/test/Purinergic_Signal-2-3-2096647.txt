Excitatory effect of ATP on rat area postrema neurons
ATP-induced inward currents and increases in the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca]in) were investigated in neurons acutely dissociated from rat area postrema using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings and fura-2 microfluorometry, respectively. The ATP-induced current (IATP) and [Ca]in increases were mimicked by 2-methylthio-ATP and ATP-γS, and were inhibited by P2X receptor (P2XR) antagonists. The current–voltage relationship of the IATP exhibited a strong inward rectification, and the amplitude of the IATP was concentration-dependent. The IATP was markedly reduced in the absence of external Na+, and the addition of Ca2+ to Na+-free saline increased the IATP. ATP did not increase [Ca]in in the absence of external Ca2+, and Ca2+ channel antagonists partially inhibited the ATP-induced [Ca]in increase, indicating that ATP increases [Ca]in by Ca2+ influx through both P2XR channels and voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels. There was a negative interaction between P2XR- and nicotinic ACh receptor (nAChR)-channels, which depended on the amplitude and direction of current flow through either channel. Current occlusion was observed at Vhs between −70 and −10 mV when the IATP and ACh-induced current (IACh) were inward, but no occlusion was observed when these currents were outward at a Vh of +40 mV. The IATP was not inhibited by co-application of ACh when the IACh was markedly decreased either by removal of permeant cations, by setting Vh close to the equilibrium potential of IACh, or by the addition of d-tubocurarine or serotonin. These results suggest that the inhibitory interaction is attributable to inward current flow of cations through the activated P2XR- and nAChR-channels.
Introduction
The rat area postrema (AP) is a medullary circum-ventricular organ located in the hindbrain at the level of the obex, with a dense vascular supply devoid of a blood-brain barrier. The lack of a blood-brain barrier makes the AP ideally placed to act as a chemosensitive trigger zone involved in the control of vomiting in response to circulating emetic substances (Borison [1, 2]). Neurons in the AP are also responsive to changes in osmolarity or sodium concentration (Franchini et al. [3]), and can be activated by circulating vasoactive peptides such as angiotensin II (Fink et al. [4]), and arg-vasopressin (Undesser et al. [5]). Anatomical studies have revealed that the AP sends dense efferent projections to the nucleus tractus solitarius, parabrachial nucleus, nucleus ambiguus, and the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, and receives afferent inputs from the hypothalamic paraventricular and dorsomedial nucleii, and from the caudal nucleus tractus solitarius (Morest [6]; Kooy and Koda [7]; Shapiro and Miselis [8]). Thus, the AP is not only capable of responding to circulating hormones, but is also anatomically well situated to regulate a range of other central neurons, including those important in cardiovascular control (Sun and Spyer [9]). The low intrinsic firing rates of AP neurons in vivo (Papas et al. [10]) suggests that understanding and modulating excitatory inputs to AP could be particularly important in the functional output of AP neurons. A number of transmitters can evoke excitatory currents in the AP. Inward currents and increases in cytosolic Ca2+ ([Ca]in) via non-NMDA-glutamate receptors have been reported in rabbit and rat AP neurons, respectively (Jahn et al. [11]; Hay and Lindsley [12]). Our preliminary reports indicated that ATP also induces inward currents and [Ca]in increases via the activation of P2X receptor (P2XR) in isolated rat AP neurons (Sorimachi et al. [13, 14]). In addition, pre- and post-synaptic nicotinic ACh receptors (nAChR) have been demonstrated in the AP in rat brain slices (Funahashi et al. [15]), and we have recently reported the presence of nAChRs in dissociated rat AP neurons (Sorimachi and Wakamori [16]). During that study, we also noticed that many of these AP neurons also responded to ATP, which has prompted us to further investigate ATP responses in AP neurons, and potential interactions between nAChR and P2XR responses. In a variety of different peripheral neurons, including sympathetic neurons of bullfrog (Akasu and Koketsu [17]), rat (Nakazawa et al. [18]), and guinea-pig (Searl et al. [19]), cultured guinea-pig enteric and submucosal neurons (Zhou and Galligan [20] Barajas-Lopez et al. [21]), a negative interaction between P2XR- and nAChR responses has been reported. Such an interaction has also been observed for recombinant P2X2 and α3β4 nAChR channels in Xenopus oocytes and HEK cells (Khakh et al. [22, 23]; Boue-Grabot et al. [24]), where it has been recently suggested that this results from direct physical interactions between co-localized receptors (Khakh et al. [23]). In this study we more fully describe P2XR responses in AP neurons, demonstrate cross-inhibition between P2XRs and nAChRs and characterize some of the features of this cross-inhibition.
Experimental procedures
Preparation of AP neurons
The study was approved by the Committee on Animal Experimentation, Kagoshima University. Wistar rats (13–18 days-old) were anaesthetized with ether and decapitated. The brain was quickly removed from the skull and placed in ice-cold HEPES-buffered saline containing 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 10 mM HEPES and 5.5 mM glucose. The pH of the saline solution was adjusted to 7.4 by adding tris (hydroxymethyl) aminomethane. The brain was sliced at a thickness of 400 µm with a microslicer (DTK-1000, Dosaka, Kyoto, Japan), and the slices were kept in bicarbonate-buffered saline bubbled continuously with 95% O2–5% CO2 at room temperature (21–26 °C). The bicarbonate-buffered saline contained 120 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 20 mM NaHCO3, 2 mM KH2PO4 and 5.5 mM glucose. Following 30–60 min incubation, the slices were treated with pronase (0.2 mg/ml) in bicarbonate-buffered saline for 20 min at 33 °C, followed by incubation for 30 min with bicarbonate-buffered saline containing thermolysin (0.12–0.15 mg/ml). The bilateral AP regions were identified with a binocular microscope (Zeiss, Germany), and were cut out using the tip of an injection needle, and subsequently mechanically triturated with fire-polished glass pipettes of decreasing diameters. Dissociated neurons were placed on to the bottom of 35 mm culture dishes (Falcon, USA) for electrophysiological recordings, or on to glass coverslips (Matsunami, Japan) coated with poly-l-lysine for [Ca]in measurements.
Electrophysiological recordings
Electrical measurements were done using the whole-cell patch-clamp recording configuration under voltage-clamp conditions. Patch pipettes were fabricated from borosilicate glass tubes in five or six stages using a pipette puller (Model P-97, Sutter Instrument, San Rafael, CA, USA). The resistance between the recording electrode filled with the internal solution, and the reference electrode in the external solution, was 3–6 MΩ. Ionic currents were measured, and voltages controlled, using a patch-clamp amplifier (EPC-9, Heka, Darmstadt, Germany). All experiments were carried out at 24–26 °C. Culture dishes were placed on an inverted microscope (TE200, Nikon, Japan), and drugs were rapidly applied to single cells using a Y-tube perfusion device. The internal solution (patch pipette solution) contained 70 mM K-gluconate, 50 mM KCl, 10 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM CaCl2, 3 mM MgCl2, 10 mM HEPES, 10 mM EGTA, and 2 mM ATP. The pH was adjusted to 7.2 with KOH. For measuring current-voltage (I–V) relationships, a Cs-based internal solution was employed, which contained 98 mM CsOH, 40 mM CsCl, 98 mM aspartate, 2 mM MgCl2, 5 mM HEPES, 5 mM EGTA, and 2 mM ATP. pH was adjusted to 7.2 with CsOH. The external solution was the HEPES-buffered saline, pH7.4, described above. When N-methyl-d-glucamine (NMDG+) or sucrose was substituted for external Na+ or NaCl, respectively, the osmolarity of the solution was kept constant as measured using an osmometer (Vogel OM801, Germany). To obtain the Ca2+/Na+ permeability ratio (PCa/PNa), we measured the reversal potential of the ATP-activated current (EATP) in the presence of 1 or 110 mM of external Ca2+ by stepping the holding potential (Vh) between 10 and 30 mV, using increments of 10 mV. The 1 and 110 mM Ca2+ solutions contained 155 or 0 mM NaCl, respectively, in addition to 10 mM HEPES with pH adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH or Ca(OH)2, respectively. The values of PCa/PCs and PNa/PCs were calculated using the constant field equation as described by Lewis ([25]), taking the activity coefficients of Na+, Cs+, and Ca2+ as 0.75, 0.75, and 0.3, respectively.
Measurement of [Ca]in
Dissociated AP neurons on a glass coverslip were incubated with 1–2 µM fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester (fura-2/AM), 0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide, and 1% bovine serum albumin for 45 min at 37 °C. The coverslips were then mounted in a superfusion chamber and placed on the stage of an inverted microscope (Diaphot-TMD, Nikon, Japan). Cells were continuously superfused at a rate of 1 ml/min with HEPES-buffered saline at 24–26 °C via a polyethylene tube placed 1–2 mm away from the cells.
Cells were viewed with a 40× Fluor objective lens (Nikon), and a single cell (10–12 µm diameter) was fixed in a window positioned between the photomultiplier and the microscope. The changes in fluorescence ratios at 340 and 380 nm excitation wavelengths were measured using a CAM-200 spectrometer (Jasco, Japan). The absolute value of [Ca]in was calculated using the formulae as given by Grynkiewicz et al. [26]: . Calibration constants were determined in separate experiments with the same experimental set-up, as described previously (Sorimachi et al. [27]).
Student’s paired t test was used to evaluate differences between mean values obtained from the same cells, and Student’s unpaired t test was used for data obtained from different groups of cells.

Results
ATP-induced current
Rapid application of ATP (100 µM) to isolated AP neurons voltage clamped at a Vh of −70 mV induced an inward current, which desensitized slowly (Fig. 1A). The ATP-induced current (IATP) was recorded at various Vhs between −70 and +50 mV (Fig. 1: N = 6), and the relative current amplitude was plotted against Vh exhibiting a strong inward rectification. The EATP, estimated from the intersection of the current response and the zero voltage-axis (Fig. 1B), was 22.7 ± 0.9 mV (N = 18).

All responses are normalized to the peak current amplitude obtained at a Vh of −70 mV, and each point is the mean ± S.E.M. of five neurons. C) Averaged concentration-current relationships for ATP in the presence of 0.1, 2, and 10 mM external Ca2+. All responses were normalized to the mean of two control responses induced by 100 µM ATP in saline containing 2 mM external Ca2+ before and after the test response. Each point is the average ± S.E.M of responses from four to six neurons.
To investigate the ATP concentration-response relationship, care was taken to adjust the pH of the solutions containing higher concentrations of ATP to 7.3, since addition of ATP reduced pH and a small decrease in pH to 7.1 increased the IATP to 189 ± 8% (N = 6) of control (pH7.3), as previously reported for recombinant P2X2 receptors (King et al. [28]). The responses to different ATP concentrations were flanked by responses to the control concentration of 100 µM, and normalized responses were expressed relative to the average of these control responses (Fig. 1C; Ca2mM). We also examined the effects of 0.1 and 10 mM Ca2+ on IATP. As summarized in Fig. 1C, an increase in the external concentration of Ca2+ shifted the concentration-response curve for ATP to the right, with the half-maximum effective concentration (EC50) values at 0.1, 2 and 10 mM Ca2+ being 30, 70, and 190 µM, respectively.
The purinergic agonists, 2-methylthio-ATP (50 µM) and ATPγS (50 µM) induced currents that were 41 ± 3% (N = 4), and 41 ± 4% (N = 5), respectively, of the IATP in response to 100 µM ATP. ADP (0.5 mM) did not produce any response. The IATP in response to 50 µM ATP was inhibited by the P2 antagonists; suramin (10 µM and 20 µM) and PPADS (50 µM), with the response being 35 ± 2% (N = 5), 25 ± 2% (N = 4), and 56 ± 5% (N = 5), of the control IATP, respectively.
ATP-induced [Ca]in increase
ATP also increased [Ca]in in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2A). These responses were all recorded in the presence of 2 mM external Ca2+, and the [Ca]in increases by various concentrations of ATP were normalized to that induced by 100 µM ATP. The normalized and averaged responses to ATP, 2-methylthio-ATP and ATPγS are shown in Fig. 2B. There was no ATP-induced [Ca]in increase in the absence of external Ca2+ (N = 6; data not shown). Furthermore, neither ADP, α,β-methylene-ATP nor β,γ-methylene-ATP increased [Ca]in when tested at concentrations of 200 µM(data not shown). The ATP-induced [Ca]in increases were inhibited by suramin and PPADS (Table 1).

Effects of Ca2+ channel antagonists on ATP-induced [Ca]in increase
Previous results, using cultured rabbit AP neurons, demonstrated the presence of a ω-conotoxin-M Csensitive Ca2+ response, but that did not involve L- or N-type Ca2+ channels (Hay et al. [29]). We also investigated the effects of various Ca2+ channel antagonists on [Ca]in increases induced by high KCl (110 mM) and ATP (100 µM). Antagonist for the L-type (nitrendipine, nicardipine), N-type (ω-conotoxin-M A), or P/Q-type (ω-conotoxin-M C) Ca2+ channels each substantially inhibited these [Ca]in increases (Table 1). In contrast, the selective P-type Ca2+ channel antagonist, ω-agatoxin IVA (1 µM), did not have any inhibitory effect on the [Ca]in increases (98 ± 5% of control, N = 4).
ATP-induced current in the absence of external Na+
When external Na+ was completely replaced by NMDG+, and in the absence of external Ca2+ (0 Ca2+ plus 0.5 mM EGTA), the IATP was markedly reduced to 8 ± 1% of the control IATP recorded in the presence of external Ca2+ and 150 mM Na+ (N = 9, Fig. 3A). This current was further reduced to 4 ± 1% (N = 3) in the presence of 20 µM suramin. The small suramin-sensitive, Na+-independent current supports the previous suggestion that the P2XR channel is permeable to glucosamine (Nakazawa [30]). To confirm this, ATP did not induce a current at all when sucrose (0.25 M) was substituted for NaCl (again in the absence of external Ca2+, N = 5). Addition of Ca2+ to the NMDG+-substituted saline further increased IATP. The currents induced by 500 µM ATP in the presence of 2 and 10 mM Ca2+, but in the absence of external Na+ (replaced by NMDG+) were 18 ± 2% (N = 11) and 29 ± 2% (N = 14, Fig. 3B) of the control IATP, respectively. Similarly, the currents induced by 500 µM ATP in the presence of 2 and 10 mM Ca2+ added to the sucrose-substituted saline were 6 ± 1% (N = 6), and 13 ± 2% (N = 16; Fig. 3C) of the control IATP, respectively.

A) A representative IATP recorded in Na+-free (Na+ replaced by NMDG+) and Ca2+-free saline (containing 0.5 mM EGTA) at a Vh of −70 mV. B) A representative IATP in Na+-free (NMDG+) saline containing 10 mM Ca2+. C) A representative IATP in NaCl-free (NaCl replaced by sucrose) saline containing 10 mM Ca2+.
We also measured the EATP of IATP in the presence of 1 mM external Ca2+ and 150 mM NaCl or 110 mM external Ca2+ and 0 mM NaCl. The EATP at 110 mM Ca2+ was 21.1 ± 1.0 mV (N = 18), from which we calculated a PCa/PCs of 6.3. The EATP at 1 mM Ca2+ was 20.2 ± 1.0 mV (N = 13), from which we calculated a PNa/PCs ratio of 2.1. From these, we obtained a PCa/PNa ratio of 3.0, confirming the substantial Ca2+ permeability of P2XRs.
Negative interaction between P2XR and nAChR channels
Requirement of actual current flow through receptor channels for cross-inhibition
It has previously been reported that there is mutual occlusion between P2XR and nAChR in some neurons (Nakazawa et al. [18]; Nakazawa [30]; Searl et al. [19]; Zhou and Galligan [20]; Barajas-Lopez et al. [21]; Khakh et al. [22, 23]; Boue-Grabot et al. [24]). To examine whether there were negative interactions between the ACh-activated current (IACh) and IATP, one receptor agonist was added in the presence of the other. As shown in Fig. 4A, the IACh (100 µM) was markedly reduced when activated in the presence of ATP (50 µM). We next examined IACh (100 µM) in the presence of various concentrations of ATP. With 2, 10, 20, and 100 µM ATP, IACh was reduced to 95 ± 1% (N = 20), 84 ± 2% (N = 24), 60 ± 4% (N = 15), and 46 ± 6% (N = 7), respectively, of control (P < 0.01 except at 2 µM ATP). Thus, the IACh inhibition became stronger as the concentration of ATP was increased and with a higher agonist-receptor occupancy. In fact, when IATP at 100 µM ATP was markedly inhibited in the presence of 200 mM PPADS (8 ± 2% of control, N = 6), IACh was not occluded (97 ± 1% of control; N = 6). When the peak amplitude of IATP, evoked by various concentrations of ATP, was plotted against the ratio of IACh in the presence and absence of ATP, there was an inverse correlation between the amplitudes of these responses (Fig. 4B). Conversely, when ATP (50 µM) was applied in the presence of ACh (100 µM), IATP was also occluded (Fig. 4C). Again, when IACh at 200 mM ACh was nullified in the presence of 1 mM hexamethonium, a nAChR antagonist (0.2 ± 0.2% of control, N = 6), IATP was 96 ± 2% (N = 6) of control. IACh at 10, 20, 50, and 200 µM ACh were 6 ± 2% (N = 5), 20 ± 4% (N = 5), 61 ± 8% (N = 6), and 139 ± 8% (N = 6) of IACh at 100 µM. There was also an inverse correlation between the peak amplitude of IACh, evoked by various concentrations of ACh, and the ratio of IATP in the presence and absence of ACh (Fig. 4D). However, the inhibition of IATP by nAChR activation was weaker than that of IACh by P2XR activation. As the IACh desensitized faster than the IATP, the weaker inhibition of IATP by ACh could be due to the reduced amplitude of the IACh at the time of ATP application.
Fig. 4Inhibition of IACh and IATP, respectively, in the presence of ATP and ACh. A) Sample currents in response to ACh (100 µM) in the presence of ATP (50 µM). The responses to ACh applied in the presence of ATP were reduced. The extent of occlusion was normalized to the control ACh responses recorded before and after ATP application. This sequence was routinely repeated twice or three times, and the averaged amount of occlusion was plotted in B. B) Relative amplitude of the ACh current amplitude in the presence of ATP (ordinate) plotted against the peak amplitude of IATP obtained in the same neuron (abscissae). Note the negative correlation between these two variables. The line was drawn using KaleidaGraph (Synergy Software). Vh: −70 mV. C) The IATP was recorded in the presence of 100 µM ACh and this response was flanked by control ATP alone responses. This sequence was routinely obtained twice or three times in the same cell, and the averaged amount of occlusion was plotted in D. D) The ratio of the ATP current amplitude in the presence and absence of ACh (ordinate) is negatively correlated with the peak amplitude of IACh (abscissae). Vh : −70 mV.
To examine this possibility, IATP was measured in the presence of both ACh and d-tubocurarine (dTc, 10 µM) or serotonin (5HT, 50 µM), two experimental conditions which change the time course of the IACh response. The former agent, dTc, has been shown to be both an open channel blocker and a competitive antagonist of nAChR (Manalis [31]), and, as expected, a low concentration (10 µM) slightly reduced the peak amplitude of IACh (79 ± 4% of control, N = 11) and caused the IACh to be terminated within 0.5 s (Fig. 5A, insert). Once the IACh response had returned to baseline (in the presence of ACh and 10 µM dTc) and ATP was applied, there was no inhibition of IATP (95 ± 1% of control, N = 5; Fig. 5A). The IATP in the presence of ACh alone was 77 ± 4% of control (N = 5, P < 0.01; Fig. 5A). When we measured the current (IACh+ATP+dTc) induced by a combination of ACh, ATP and dTc, the peak amplitude of IACh+ATP+dTc was occluded under these conditions, being 74 ± 2% (N = 10) of the predicted sum of IATP and IACh+ dTc (Fig. 5B). The level of IACh+ATP+dTc at 0.5 s following ligand application, which corresponds to a time when the nAChR channels are completely blocked (Fig. 5A, insert), was 96 ± 3% (N = 8) of the control IATP, measured immediately before and after (Fig. 5C). These results suggest that the inhibition of IATP by IACh disappears immediately after the IACh is abolished, although ACh is still present and bound to the nAChRs. 5HT has been shown to also accelerate the decay of IACh (Grassi et al. [32]; Garcia-Colunga and Miledi [33]; Sorimachi and Wakamori [34]), but not to the same extent as dTc. 5HT at 50 µM decreased the peak amplitude of IACh slightly, to 88 ± 4% (N = 6) of control, and reduced the time constant (tau) of IACh decay from 2.02 ± 0.18 to 1.06 ± 0.19 s (N = 6). As shown in Fig. 5D, the extent of inhibition of IATP by ACh was smaller (to 92 ± 2% of control, N = 6) in the presence of ACh and 5HT compared to that in the presence of ACh alone (to 73 ± 3% of control, N = 6; P < 0.01).
Fig. 5Loss of the inhibition of IATP by ACh in the presence of dTc and 5HT. A) Representative IATP in control conditions (applied alone), in the presence of ACh and in the presence of ACh and dTc. This sequence was routinely repeated twice, and the averaged response was obtained. Note the very transient nature of IACh in the presence of dTc, with the current returning to baseline levels within 0.5 s (insert). Note also the lack of occlusion under these conditions. Vh: −70 mV. B) Effect of dTc on IACh+ATP. The sequence of applications was repeated multiple times in each neuron. The peak amplitude of IACh+ATP+dTc was smaller than the predicted sum of IATP and IACh+dTc. C) Rapid recovery of IATP from inhibition by ACh in the presence of dTc. The amplitude of IACh+ATP+dTc 0.5 s following application was equal to the mean of two control IATP at an equivalent time. Inset shows the rapid decline of IACh+ATP+dTc on an expanded time scale. D) Representative IATP in control conditions, in the presence of ACh, and in the presence of both ACh and 5HT. In this example, the tau of IACh in response to the first application was 2.7 s, while the tau of IACh+5HT was 0.9 s, showing the acceleration of the IACh decay by 5HT. Note the reduced occlusion under these conditions. Vh : −70 mV.
Next, we measured the current induced by the concomitant applications of ACh and ATP (IACh+ATP) at a Vh of −70 mV. As shown in Fig. 6A, IACh+ATP was 75 ± 1% (N = 44; P < 0.01) of the predicted sum of IACh and IATP. The decay phase of IACh, IATP and IACh+ATP were fit to a single exponential function, giving tau of 3.0 ± 0.2, 7.5 ± 0.6 and 3.7 ± 0.2 s, respectively. When the decay of IACh was accelerated by the presence of 100 µM 5HT, the tau of IACh, IATP, and IACh+ATP were 0.8 ± 0.3 s (N = 7), 7.4 ± 1.4 s (N = 7) and 2.6 ± 0.8 s (N = 7), respectively (the amplitude of IACh+ATP under these conditions was 76 ± 2% of the predicted sum of IACh and IATP). Thus, IACh+ATP desensitization occurs with kinetics that cannot be explained by the desensitization kinetics of IACh or IATP alone, suggesting that IACh+ATP is mediated via both receptors.
Fig. 6Voltage dependence of IACh and of IATP occlusion. A) At a Vh of −70 mV, co-application of ACh (200 µM) and ATP (100 µM) induced an inward current that was smaller in amplitude than the predicted sum of the individual IACh and IATP. B) At a Vh of +40 mV, the amplitude of the outward current induced by the co-application of ACh (500 µM) and ATP (200 µM) was equal to the predicted sum of the individual IACh and IATP. C) Co-application of ATP and ACh does not markedly change EACh or EATP. Representative currents induced by ACh, ATP, and by co-application of ACh and ATP at a Vh of +10 mV. Note that IACh+ATP is composed of early outward and delayed inward current, corresponding to the ACh component and the ATP component, respectively.
When Ca2+ was omitted from extracellular solution, the negative interaction between the two receptor channels was still obtained; with IACh+ATP being 77 ± 1% (N = 5; P < 0.01) of the predicted sum of IACh and IATP. Hence negative interaction is not mediated by a Ca2+ influx-dependent mechanism, although both nAChR and P2XR are Ca2+-permeable cation channels (Fieber and Adams [35]; Rogers and Dani [36]). This result, however, does not necessarily rule out the possible involvement of [Ca]in in negative interaction.
Occlusion was not only observed at a Vh of −70 mV; IACh+ATP at Vhs of −20, and −10 mV were 80 ± 2% (N = 12; P < 0.01), and 76 ± 2% (N = 8; P < 0.01), respectively, of the predicted sum of IACh and IATP. In sharp contrast, such occlusion was not observed at a positive potential; the outward current caused by coapplication of ACh and ATP at a Vh of +40 mV was 100 ± 1% (N = 10) of the predicted sum of individual current (Fig. 6B).
We next investigated the possibility that the combined addition of ACh and ATP alters the driving force for Na+, by attempting to measure EACh+ATP. In these studies, currents in response to ACh, ATP and both ligands were measured at various fixed potentials close to the reversal potential for IACh and IATP. The EACh and EATP were 8.7 ± 1.5 mV (N = 5) and 21.0 ± 1.6 mV (N = 7), respectively, and IACh+ATP measured at a potential between these two reversal potentials (e.g.10 mV, Fig. 6C) showed a combination of both the ACh-induced outward current and the ATP-induced inward current. These results suggest that the driving force for permeant ions during combined ACh and ATP is similar to that during the application of each ligand separately.
The question arises as to whether occlusion is specific just for Na+ ions or whether inward currents carried by cations other than Na+ can also contribute to occlusion during co-activation of nAChRs and P2XRs. To address this question, we measured IACh, IATP, and IACh +ATP in the presence of Na+-free (NMDG+) saline containing 10 mM Ca2+ (Fig. 7). NMDG+ does not permeate through nAChR (Sorimachi and Wakamori [16]), and hence IACh would be mediated by only Ca2+ influx, whereas IATP would be mediated via both NMDG+ and Ca2+ influx (Fig. 3). Under these conditions, IACh+ATP was again occluded, being 70 ± 3% of the predicted sum of IACh and IATP (N = 11; P < 0.01; Fig. 7).
Fig. 7Occlusion of IACh+ATP in the presence of Na+-free saline containing 10 mM Ca2+. IACh, IATP or IACh+ATP was recorded 20 s after switching to Na+-free (replaced by NMDG+) saline containing 10 mM Ca2+. The sequence of applications was repeated multiple times. Following each ligand application, the external solution was changed back to normal saline containing 150 mM Na+ before the next ligand application. Vh: −70 mV.
In a further attempt to distinguish whether channel activation or ion permeation was primarily responsible for occlusion of one channel by the other, we compared IATP with IACh+ATP under two experimental conditions, in which a higher concentration of ACh should activate nAChR but produce very little current. In the absence of Na+ and Ca2+ (replaced by NMDG+) application of ACh induces a negligible current (Sorimachi and Wakamori [16]), while ATP induces a substantial current under the same conditions (Fig. 3A). As shown in Fig. 8B, there was no occlusion in these conditions; the amplitude of IATP+ACh was 105 ± 1% (N = 10) of the predicted sum of IATP and IACh. We also investigated currents in response to the ligands at a potential close to the EACh (7 ± 2 mV in this experiment, N = 13), taking advantage of the more positive EATP (22.7 ± 0.9 mV), so that at this potential only the IATP was observed. The amplitude of IATP+ACh was 105 ± 3% (N = 13) of that of IATP, and IACh was close to zero (Fig. 8D). These results are, however, in contrast to that obtained in sympathetic neurons (Nakazawa[30]), in which IATP in the absence of both Na+ (replaced by glucosamine) and Ca2+ was inhibited in the presence of ACh, which caused no current (Nakazawa [30]). In these experiments, we only included data in which IATP was large enough to be clearly resolved, greater than 50 pA (corresponding to a control IATP at a Vh of −70 mV larger than 1.5 nA). These results suggest that actual current flow through both nAChR and P2XR is responsible for occlusion.

A) Control IACh recorded at a Vh of −70 mV in standard saline. B) Current responses recorded at −70 mV from 20 s after exchanging the standard saline for a Na+-free (replaced by NMDG+), Ca2+-free saline. This sequence was repeated twice or three times. Note the small amplitude of IACh, and the lack of occlusion of IACh+ATP. C) Control IACh recorded at a Vh of −70 mV in another neuron. D) Representative traces of IACh, IATP, and IACh+ATP recorded at a Vh of +7 mV, which is very close to EACh. Note the lack of occlusion at this potential, when current flow through the AChR is negligible.
Discussion
In this study, we found that ATP induced an inward current and increased [Ca]in in isolated rat AP neurons. The ATP-induced current and [Ca]in increase were mimicked by ATPγS and 2-methylthio-ATP, but not by α,β-methylene-ATP, β, γ-methylene-ATP nor ADP, and was inhibited by suramin and PPADS, suggesting that it was mediated by P2XRs. These results are in good agreement with previous histochemical findings, which demonstrated the presence of P2X2, P2X4, and P2X6 receptor mRNAs (Collo et al. [37]), and of P2X2 receptor immunoreactivity in AP neurons (Kanjhan et al. [38]; Atkinson et al. [39]).
The IATP showed strong inward rectification and the EATP was 22.7 ± 0.9 mV (Fig. 1B). The amplitude of IATP varied inversely with the extracellular Ca2+ concentrations (Fig. 1C). The inhibitory effect of increasing extracellular Ca2+ has also been reported in rat sensory neurons (Krishtal et al. [40]), PC-12 cells (Nakazawa et al. [18]), ventromedial hypothalamic neurons (Sorimachi et al. [41]), and in cells expressing recombinant P2X2 receptors (Evans et al. [42]; Virginio et al. [43]), where an allosteric alteration of the ATP binding sites has been suggested to be the underlying mechanism.
The IATP was markedly reduced, but still persisted when NMDG+ was substituted for external Na+ even in the absence of Ca2+ (Fig. 3A). Since ATP did not induce a current when sucrose was substituted for external NaCl, our result suggests that NMDG+ could permeate through P2XR. A substantial IATP has been similarly reported in PC-12 cells and sympathetic neurons when glucosamine was substituted for Na+ (Nakazawa et al. [18]; Nakazawa [30]). The addition of Ca2+ to NMDG-Cl- and sucrose-substituted saline increased the IATP (Fig. 3B and C, respectively), indicating that Ca2+ also permeates through P2XR channel. We quantified the relatively high Ca2+ permeability, obtaining a PCa/PNa ratio of 3.0. A relatively high permeability of P2XR to Ca2+ has been reported in previous studies (Nakazawa et al. [18]; Sorimachi et al. [41]; Evans et al. [42]; Virginio et al. [43]). Although direct influx of extracellular Ca2+ through P2XR channel may thus contribute to the ATP-induced [Ca]in increase, membrane depolarization and the secondary activation of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels could also make a significant contribution to the [Ca]in increase. In fact, the high K+- and ATP-induced [Ca]in increases were substantially inhibited by a range of Ca2+ channel antagonists, including those which block L- and N-type Ca2+ channels (Table 1). This is in contrast to a previous study, which reported an absence of the L- and N-type Ca2+ channels in rabbit AP neurons (Hay et al. [12]). The discrepancies between their results and ours could be, at least in part, accounted for by the use of different AP preparations (cultured rabbit neurons vs. acutely dissociated rat neurons).
The present results, in combination with our previous demonstration of nAChR on AP neurons (Sorimachi and Wakamori [16]), suggest that both ATP and ACh may act as excitatory neurotransmitters in AP neurons, although their release from presynaptic nerve terminals has not yet been reported. We also report a negative functional interaction between P2XRs and nAChRs in AP neurons, as has been observed in a variety of peripheral neurons and in recombinant expression systems (Nakazawa et al. [18]; Nakazawa [30]; Zhou and Galligan [20]; Barajas-Lopez et al. [21]; Searl et al. [19]; Khakh et al. [22, 23]; Boue-Grabot et al. [24]). This is the first report, that we are aware of, of such interactions occurring in central neurons. When ACh was applied in the presence of ATP, there was a positive correlation between the peak amplitude of inward IATP and the amount of occlusion of inward IACh (Fig. 4A and B). The converse was also true when ATP was applied in the presence of ACh (Fig. 4C and D). Non-additivity of the IACh+ATP was observed even when the inward current was carried by NMDG+ and/or Ca2+ (Fig. 7). Co-application of two agonists did not seem to change the driving force for Na+, because at a Vh between EACh and EATP an outward current due to the activation of nAChR, followed by an inward current due to the activation of P2XR, was observed (Fig. 6C). Occlusion was also observed at a Vh of −10 mV, which is closer to EACh or EATP. Furthermore, the removal of external Ca2+ did not alter the occlusion, and thus a Ca2+-mediated mechanism does not contribute to the current occlusion.
The IACh+ATP occlusion was observed at all negative holding potentials when the current was inward but was not observed for outward currents at a Vh of +40 mV. Here the outward IACh+ATP was not different from the predicted sum of IACh and IATP (Fig. 6B). The same dependence on current direction has been reported in guinea-pig enteric and submucosal neurons (Zhou and Galligan [20]; Barajas-Lopez et al. [21]), suggesting that the current occlusion was triggered by the inward movement of cations through two channels.
Some investigators have shown that the amplitude of IACh+ATP is equal to or even smaller than that of either IACh or IATP. For instance, the concentration of one agonist causing little or no inward current produced dramatic occlusion of the inward current generated by the other agonist (Searl et al. [19]). Khakh et al. [22] using Xenopus oocytes co-expressing P2X2 and α3β4 nAChR channels, provided several lines of evidence which indicated that occlusion was mostly mediated by the inhibition of the nAChR channel by activation of the P2XR. However, we found that concomitant application of two agonists always caused a larger current than either agonist (Fig. 6A), and that the amount of occlusion of one channel current in the presence of the other channel agonist was correlated with the amplitude of current through the other channel (Fig. 4). Furthermore, we found that IACh+ATP desensitizes faster than IATP, but more slowly than IACh, and IACh+ATP at a Vh between EACh and EATP showed a combination pattern of early outward IACh and delayed inward IATP (Fig. 6C). These results both strongly suggest that in AP neurons, IACh+ATP are carried through both nAChR and P2XR channels, and that inhibition between these channels is reciprocal.
The IATP was not inhibited by co-application of ACh when the inward IACh was markedly reduced in the absence of permeant cations (Fig. 8B) or at a Vh very close to EACh (Fig. 8D), and the inhibited IATP in the presence of ACh (Fig. 5B) recovered as soon as the nAChR channel closed in the presence of dTc (Fig. 5C). These results thus suggest that the inhibitory interaction not only requires the activation of both receptor channels, but also requires a substantial current to flow through these channels. These results are in contrast to that obtained in sympathetic neurons, in which the ATP-induced glucosamine influx was inhibited in the presence of ACh (Nakazawa [30]). The cause of this inconsistency remained unknown, but may reflect a real difference in the underlying mechanisms of occlusion in these two types of neurons.
Altogether, our results have characterized the P2XR responses in AP neurons and the cross-inhibition between P2XRs and nAChRs in AP neurons. We show that the current flow through one receptor channel hinders the current flow through the other channel. These interactions support the notion that these channels are positioned very close to each other, as has been previously considered (Zhou and Galligan [20]; Barajas-Lopez et al. [21]; Khakh et al. [22]; Boue-Grabot et al. [24]) and more recently demonstrated for recombinant channels (Khakh et al. [23]). These results will be important to consider when designing ligands to modify excitability of ATP neurons and may have some physiological function during co-activation of P2XRs and nAChRs by synaptically released transmitters.
