Crosstalk between the Protein Surface and Hydrophobic Core in a Core-swapped Fibronectin Type III Domain
Two homologous fibronectin type III (fnIII) domains, FNfn10 (the 10th fnIII domain of human fibronectin) and TNfn3 (the third fnIII domain of human tenascin), have essentially the same backbone structure, although they share only ∼ 24% sequence identity. While they share a similar folding mechanism with a common core of key residues in the folding transition state, they differ in many other physical properties. We use a chimeric protein, FNoTNc, to investigate the molecular basis for these differences. FNoTNc is a core-swapped protein, containing the “outside” (surface and loops) of FNfn10 and the hydrophobic core of TNfn3. Remarkably, FNoTNc retains the structure of the parent proteins despite the extent of redesign, allowing us to gain insight into which components of each parent protein are responsible for different aspects of its behaviour. Naively, one would expect properties that appear to depend principally on the core to be similar to TNfn3, for example, the response to mutations, folding kinetics and side-chain dynamics, while properties apparently determined by differences in the surface and loops, such as backbone dynamics, would be more like FNfn10. While this is broadly true, it is clear that there are also unexpected crosstalk effects between the core and the surface. For example, the anomalous response of FNfn10 to mutation is not solely a property of the core as we had previously suggested.
Introduction
Studies of the folding of structurally related proteins have been a
powerful tool for investigating conservation of folding pathways,1 identifying structurally important residues,2 and examining the role of highly conserved
residues.3 One of the most common folds in the SCOP database4 is the immunoglobulin (Ig)-like fold. Over 40,000 Ig-like
domains have been identified in the current PFam database5 and the fold is found in a number of different superfamilies,
where there is no apparent sequence identity between superfamilies.4 In this study, rather than seeking to understand what related
proteins have in common, we ask a different question—can differences between
closely related proteins be explained?
Many members of the Ig-like fold have been well characterised, leading to:
identification of the key residues essential for formation of the Greek key
structure,6,7 the observation of a correlation between stability and folding
rate,8–11 the identification of a common folding pathway,12–16 and the identification of the role of conserved proline
residues3 and the conserved tyrosine corner motif.2 However, when two Ig-like domains from the fibronectin type III
(fnIII) superfamily, the 10th fnIII domain of human fibronectin (FNfn10) and the
third fnIII domain of human tenascin (TNfn3), were studied in detail and
compared, they were found to differ markedly in several respects. FNfn10 and
TNfn3 are essentially structurally identical (backbone RMSD is 1.2 Å), but have
low sequence identity (24%). They differ in their stabilities17,18 and response to mutation19; they differ in their folding kinetics17,18,20 (although they share a common folding mechanism12,16); they display different backbone and side-chain
dynamics21–23`; and, finally, they differ in their response to mechanical
force.24–26 Why do proteins that are structurally almost identical behave
so differently? Which components of a protein are responsible for the various
aspects of its behaviour? How independent are the properties of the surface and
hydrophobic core? We have addressed these questions by making a chimera of these
two fnIII domains.
The chimera, FNoTNc, was created with the “outside” (surface and loops) of
FNfn10 and the core of TNfn3.26 Fifteen mutations were made in the core of FNfn10 so that all
buried residues (with < 10% solvent-accessible surface
area) are identical with those residues in the core of TNfn3 (total number of
core residues = 27) (Fig. 1). Thus, we
can test how transferable the properties of the core and surface of the
respective parents are when combined in this way. FNoTNc is a stable, folded
protein that is structurally almost identical with the parent proteins
(Supplementary Fig. 1). FNoTNc has
also retained the cell-adhesion activity of the FNfn10 parent protein mediated
by specific integrin binding.26 We have previously used this chimera to demonstrate that
resistance to mechanical force is a core property: FNoTNc has mechanical
unfolding properties indistinguishable from TNfn3 and very different from
FNfn10.26 Here we investigate the stability, folding and dynamics of the
new, chimeric protein.
Most protein engineering analyses concentrate on the hydrophobic core of
proteins, since it was shown in 1959 that the hydrophobic interaction is the
major factor involved in protein folding27 and surface mutations rarely affect protein stability by more
than ∼ 1 kcal mol− 1. Our
results suggest, however, that the surface and loops can play a key (and
sometimes unexpected) role in determining the biophysical properties of a
protein.
Results
Thermodynamic stability
Wild-type FNoTNc
FNoTNc has a free energy of unfolding
(ΔGD–N) of 7.5 kcal
mol− 1, intermediate between
the stabilities of FNfn10 and TNfn3 (9.4 and 6.7 kcal
mol− 1, respectively) at pH
5.0. We infer that the surface interactions and loop and turn regions of
FNfn10 make a significant contribution to the overall stability of
FNoTNc. As was shown for FNfn10, the
ΔGD–N of FNoTNc is
independent of pH between pH 5.0 and pH 7.0, whereas TNfn3 is less
stable at pH 7 (5.7 kcal mol− 1). The
dependence of the stability of TNfn3 on pH has been shown to be the
result of the presence of patches of acidic residues on the surface of
TNfn3, which are, of course, not present in FNoTNc.17
Anomalous response of certain peripheral mutations
A number of core residues were mutated in FNoTNc to investigate the
response of the protein to mutation. These were positions that had
previously been investigated in the parent proteins FNfn10 and TNfn3.
The thermodynamic stability of the mutant proteins was determined by
chemical denaturation in guanidinium chloride (GdmCl). The mutations can
clearly be divided into two categories. A few peripheral mutations
(mutations in the A and G strands and the B–C loop) have little effect
on stability as was previously observed in FNfn10 (Fig. 2a),
whereas most other mutations were more typically destabilising. In the
latter case, the ΔΔGD–N was
similar to (but in general slightly lower than) what had been observed
previously in TNfn3 (Fig. 2b).
The residues in each category are mapped onto a backbone ribbon
representation of FNoTNc in Fig.
2c. ΔΔGD–N values
for all mutations are compared to those of FNfn10 and TNfn3 in
Supplementary Table
1.
Equilibrium hydrogen exchange
The rates of hydrogen–deuterium exchange were measured at pD 7.0.
Measured rate constants for exchange,
kex, ranged between 9.3 × 10− 2 and 1.6 × 10− 4 min− 1. Values of
kex and the apparent free
energies of exchange,
ΔGexapp,
are listed in Supplementary Table
2. The
ΔGexapp of
FNoTNc, FNfn10 and TNfn3 are compared in Fig.
3. The hydrogen
exchange behaviour of FNoTNc clearly resembles that of FNfn10: both have
many residues that exchange in the experimental dead time, in particular
in the edge strands (A, C′, E and G strands) that are more protected in
TNfn3. Note that this does not result from differences in the intrinsic
stabilities of the domains—TNfn3 is significantly less stable than
either FNoTNc or FNfn10 under these experimental conditions.
Folding kinetics
Wild-type FNoTNc
The rate constants of folding and unfolding were determined using
stopped-flow measurements monitored by changes in fluorescence
> 320 nm. The logarithm of the folding and
unfolding rate constants was plotted against concentration of denaturant
(Fig. 4). Both unfolding and refolding arms show a linear
dependence on denaturant concentration. There is an additional refolding
phase, which we attribute to proline isomerisation and do not consider
further. (Both FNfn10 and TNfn3 have proline-isomerisation limited
phases, and FNoTNc has eight Pro residues.) To compare the kinetics of
FNoTNc with those of FNfn10 and TNfn3 (which have been studied using
different denaturants due to large differences in stability), the
logarithm of the observed rate constants is plotted against stability in
Fig. 4. The free energy of
unfolding calculated from the ratio of the folding and unfolding rate
constants extrapolated to 0 M denaturant (7.7  kcal mol− 1) and the kinetic m
value (2.1 kcal mol− 1
M− 1) are the same as the
equilibrium ΔGD–N (7.5 kcal
mol− 1) and
m value (2.1 kcal mol− 1 M− 1) within
error—consistent with the folding being a 2-state process, with no
stable intermediates being populated. The relative compactness of the
transition state can be determined from the folding and unfolding
m values. FNoTNc has a βT
value of 0.6, similar to those of TNfn3 and FNfn10.
Φ-value analysis
The folding kinetics of 18 variants of FNoTNc with nondisruptive
deletion mutations were measured as for the wild type. Few of these
mutants were in the A, B and G strands due to very small changes in
stability with mutation in general. In a few of the mutants, the
unfolding arm of the chevron plots shows negative curvature at high
denaturant concentrations, which we attribute to the Hammond effect: the
simplest model that fits the data.28–30 All chevrons were fitted therefore to a two-state
equation with a quadratic term in the unfolding arm. (All the chevron
plots are shown in Supplementary Fig.
2.) Note that the model chosen to fit the kinetic data
does not affect our results because equilibrium values of
ΔΔGD–N were used to
determine Φ. In Table
1, the Φ values for
each mutant are compared to those in TNfn3 and FNfn10. The Φ values are
generally low, closely resembling those of TNfn3.
Dynamics
Backbone dynamics
15N
T1 and
T2 relaxation time constants
and 1H15N nuclear
Overhauser enhancement parameters were measured using 1H–15N correlation spectroscopy
(Supplementary Table 3).
The generalised order parameter,
S2, and a conformational
exchange broadening parameter,
Rex, were determined for each
backbone amide (Fig.
5 and Supplementary Table 4). The
S2 values are similar to
those of both the parents. However, the high values of
Rex that were seen in the
A/B region of FNfn10, have decreased in FNoTNc.
Side-chain dynamics
The relaxation of the operator terms IzCzDz, IzCzDy and IzCz was measured to give deuterium relaxation time constants
T1(D) and
T2(D)31 (Supplementary Table
5). Order parameters,
S2, were determined for each
methyl group using the standard model-free formalism as previously
described22 (Supplementary Table
6). The dynamics data for those methyl groups that had
overlapping peaks were treated with caution, as the contribution from
the overlapped peaks cannot be separated. Nevertheless, we have some
confidence in these results due to the agreement of the order parameters
for residues that have both overlapped and well-resolved methyl groups.
S2 ranges from zero to
unity, with higher values of S2
indicating greater conformational restriction. The methyl
S2 values are shown
projected onto the protein structure and compared to the parent proteins
in Fig. 6. Within the core of FNoTNc is a cluster of deeply
buried residues, which have unusually low order parameters, as has
previously been observed in TNfn3.
Discussion
The core of FNoTNc is similar to that of TNfn3, but apparently less closely
packed.
Evidence from mutations
FNoTNc is close in structure to both the parent domains (backbone RMSD,
excluding the mobile C–C′ and F–G loops, is 0.95 and 0.89 Å compared to
FNfn10 and TNfn3, respectively). From the crystal structure we would deduce
that the core of FNoTNc is essentially the same in terms of core packing and
number of core contacts as TNfn3, the parent protein that donated the core
residues (Fig. 7a). However, the calculated free volume in the interior of
FNoTNc is larger than for TNfn3 (128.4 Å3
versus 118.1 Å3, respectively). When
the response of FNoTNc to mutation is compared to TNfn3, it is clear that
the ΔΔGD–N values of FNoTNc are
slightly lower, on average ∼ 80% of those in TNfn3
(Fig. 7b). Since the loss of
free energy on mutation is strongly correlated with the number of side-chain
contacts deleted,32,33 we infer that the less tight packing of the core of FNoTNc
accounts for the difference in
ΔΔGD–N compared to TNfn3.
Evidence from side-chain dynamics
The same conclusion can be drawn from the analysis of the side-chain
dynamics. The core of TNfn3 has been shown to be exceptionally mobile, with
several of the most buried residues falling several standard deviations
below the expected order parameter for their residue type.22,23 FNfn10 has a core that is much more conformationally
restricted, with order parameters within the usual range for buried
residues. Our previous analysis of the side-chain dynamics of FNfn10 and
TNfn3 led us to suggest that the differences in core dynamics between FNfn10
and TNfn3 could, at least in part, be ascribed to the slightly lower core
packing in TNfn3; the residues in TNfn3 with unusually low order parameters
are also found to have packing volumes that are larger than expected. The
buried side chains of FNoTNc were found to have, on average, even lower
order parameters than the same side chains in TNfn3 (Fig. 6d).
Behaviour of peripheral regions of the protein is modulated by
the surface and loops
Evidence from mutation
A number of sites in FNfn10 were identified where upon mutation the
ΔΔGD–N is significantly
lower than for the same (or an equivalent) mutation in
TNfn3.19 These sites are at the periphery of the protein and
include residues Pro5 and Leu8 (A strand), Pro25 (B–C loop) and residues
Ser85 and Phe92 (G strand). Unexpectedly, in FNoTNc we see the same
anomalous response to mutation for Pro5, Pro25 and Ser85, although Ile8A
and Phe92A now have similar
ΔΔGD–N values to TNfn3
(Fig. 2a). Pro5, Pro25 and
Ser85 are all found in the same region of the molecule (Fig. 2c). The anomalous response to
mutation in this peripheral region of the core of FNoTNc and FNfn10 is
intriguing: apparently the “plastic” response of the protein to mutation
of these three buried residues is modulated by the surface of the
protein and is not determined by the core alone. The additional
plasticity at this end of the hydrophobic core may be due to its
proximity to the longer FG loop in FNfn10 and FNoTNc, which restricts
motion less than the corresponding loop in TNfn3.
Evidence from hydrogen exchange
FNoTNc, FNfn10 and TNfn3 have very similar structures and hydrogen
bonding patterns. Further evidence for “plasticity” of FNfn10 compared
to TNfn3 came from the observation that the peripheral A, C′, E and G
strands were significantly less well protected against amide exchange in
FNfn10 than in TNfn3, despite the fact that FNfn10 is considerably more
stable than TNfn3.19 Under the experimental conditions, hydrogen exchange is
in the EX2 regime,34,35 meaning that exchange reflects local stability; that
is, these peripheral regions of FNfn10 have lower local stabilities than
TNfn3. Our experiments clearly show that the exchange behaviour of
FNoTNc is similar to FNfn10—with low protection of residues in the same
peripheral strands (Fig. 3).
Again surprisingly, local instability appears to be a function of the
surface of the protein and not a property of the core; however, the
plasticity inferred from response to mutation and local instability
still appear to be related, as was previously inferred. This is not,
however, related to slow exchange motions of the backbone, as we had
previously suggested, since the millisecond time scale motions observed
in the A/B region of FNfn10 are not found in FNoTNc.
The stability of FNoTNc is modulated by both the core and the
surface
In summary, despite the evidence for FNoTNc having a less well packed
core than TNfn3, with the mutation of buried side chains having less effect
on the overall stability (Fig.
7b), FNoTNc is significantly more stable than TNfn3,
suggesting again that the surface and loops of FNfn10 contribute
significantly to the stability of FNoTNc. This is not a new observation; it
has been previously demonstrated that surface interactions can play a
significant role in the stabilisation of proteins.36 Interestingly, however, the “local stability” of the
peripheral regions of FNoTNc is lower than the local stability of TNfn3, as
manifested in the hydrogen exchange experiments. The surface residues of
FNfn10 are modulating the stability of these peripheral regions.
A concurrent study by Siggers et
al.37 investigated the stability and dynamics of a series of
loop-swap mutants of FNfn10 and TNfn3: essentially these were mutants where
the C–C′ and F–G loops were exchanged. Interestingly, both TNfn3 domains had
lower thermal stabilities than the wild-type protein, whereas the thermal
stability of FNfn10 was unaffected by the exchange. We infer that in our
chimeric protein, interactions of the surface residues are most important in
the increase in stabilisation of FNoTNc beyond that of TNfn3, and not the
new C–C′ and F–G loops.
The TNfn3 core governs the folding kinetics
Wild-type kinetics
In order to compare the kinetics of the three proteins directly,
the logarithm of the rate constant has been plotted against stability
(Fig. 4). This unusual
scale is used as each protein was characterised using a different
denaturant. FNoTNc folds at a rate intermediate between FNfn10 and
TNfn3. In broad terms, the chevron of FNoTNc resembles that of TNfn3. It
has previously been pointed out that the folding rates of Ig-like
domains in water do not correlate with contact order (the average
sequence separation of native contacts).8,38 For the present three proteins, which have almost
identical contact order (absolute contact order 15–16%, relative contact
order 16–17%), the rate constants at the folding midpoint span 2.5
orders of magnitude. Thus, the variation in the folding rate cannot be
explained only by differences in contact order—protein stability plays a
key role.8,39
FNfn10 shows clear rollover in both the folding and unfolding arms.
The rollover in the folding arm has previously been ascribed to the
presence of a populated folding intermediate.18 Neither FNoTNc nor TNfn3 show any evidence for
population of a folding intermediate—the presence of a stable folding
intermediate in FNfn10 appears to be the result of core interactions.
Curvature in the unfolding arm of a chevron plot has been ascribed
to the presence of a high-energy intermediate, to Hammond effects, or to
population of an unfolding intermediate.30,40,41 This has not been investigated for any of these fnIII
domains; indeed, it is often not possible to distinguish between the
first two cases.42 Both FNfn10 and some mutants of FNoTNc display curvature
in the unfolding arm that is not seen in wild-type TNfn3. It should be
noted, however, that unfolding curvature has been seen in a less stable
form of TNfn3 (missing the final two C-terminal residues) and may simply
not be observed in this case because the unfolding arm in the stable
form of TNfn3 used here is relatively short. In summary, FNoTNc has
similar folding characteristics to TNfn3. This suggests that the core of
these proteins plays the major role in determining the folding
behaviour.
However, FNoTNc is more stable than TNfn3. When we compare the
folding and unfolding rate constants in water we find that FNoTNc folds
some 10 times faster than TNfn3
(kfH2O = 60 and 6 s− 1, respectively) but unfolds at approximately the same
rate as TNfn3
(kuH2O = 2 × 10− 4 and 5 × 10− 4 s− 1, respectively).
Thus, the stabilising surface interactions apparently stabilise the
transition state of FNoTNc as much as the native state, while still not
causing a folding intermediate to be populated. This, perhaps, allows us
to pinpoint further which surface interactions are responsible for the
added stability of FNoTNc (over TNfn3). At the transition state, the
loops and the peripheral A and G strands are largely unstructured, but
there is structure in the B, C, C′, E and F strands, particularly
towards the centre of the core (see Φ value section below). Interactions
between surface residues in these strands are therefore the most likely
candidates for providing additional stability to the FNoTNc protein
(both native and transition states), above those interactions between
residues that are packing in the core.
In contrast, FNoTNc folds some three times more slowly than FNfn10
and the unfolding rate constant of FNfn10 in water is approximately an
order of magnitude lower (∼ 2 × 10− 5
s− 1).
Φ-value analysis
The Φ-value analysis reveals the extent of formation of structure
in the transition state.43 The pattern of Φ values in FNfn10 and TNfn3 are similar,
suggesting that they have a common folding mechanism. There are
differences, however. The Φ values of TNfn3 tend to be much lower than
those of FNfn10: TNfn3 has five Φ values greater than 0.4,12 while FNfn10 has eight16; in FNfn10 the folding nucleus appears to be more
extensive than in TNfn3, with more than one residue in the central C, E
and F strands having high Φ values. FNoTNc has even lower average Φ
values than TNfn3 with only two Φ values greater than 0.4 (Table 1) Both FNoTNc and TNfn3 have less
extensive formation of structure in the transition state than FNfn10.
However, Φ-value analysis is at its most powerful when patterns of
Φ values are compared in different proteins rather than by direct
comparison of Φ values. Previous analysis of TNfn3 has identified a ring
of interacting residues in the B, C, E and F strands as the folding
nucleus, with residues in the C′ strand packing onto these.12 The Φ values of the peripheral A and G strands are all
close to 0, suggesting that they are unformed at the transition state. A
similar pattern of Φ values was seen in FNfn10, although this Φ-value
analysis was less complete.16 The Φ values for FNoTNc were divided into three
categories of low (Φ < 0.25),
medium (0.25 < Φ < 0.35) and high (Φ > 0.35) (Fig. 8)
and compared to the pattern of Φ values for the identical residues in
TNfn3. The pattern of Φ values is very similar to that of TNfn3,
although there are slight qualitative differences. Again, the highest Φ
values are found in the B, C, C′, E and Φ strands and the Φ values in
the A and G strands are ∼ 0. The folding mechanism of
FNoTNc is unperturbed and the same as both the parents, although from
the magnitude and extent of the residues with higher Φ values the
transition-state structure appears to be closer to that of TNfn3 than
FNfn10.
Dynamics from NMR is determined by local interactions
Side-chain dynamics
The side-chain dynamics appear to reflect core packing, as was
discussed above, and so FNoTNc resembles TNfn3 more closely than
FNfn10.
Backbone dynamics
The S2 values of FNoTNc are
generally very similar to those of both the parents (Fig. 5). It is interesting to compare
our study with that of the loop swap mutants of FNfn10 and TNfn3 from
Palmer and coworkers,37 where the F–G loop of FNfn10 was grafted into TNfn3. In
that case, the S2 values in the
loop region were more similar to those in FNfn10, than those in the
equivalent positions in TNfn3. A similar result was seen in the protein
where the C–C′ loop was grafted in. It is difficult to compare our
results directly to those of Siggers
et al.37: their method of analysis leads to greater differences
between the S2 values of FNfn10
and TNfn3, resulting in more visible effects on the
S2 values when the loops are
swapped than we see in FNoTNc compared to the parent proteins. However,
there is a general agreement that the behaviour of the loops is a local
property, rather than being a direct effect of either core or surface
interactions.
Conclusion
We have grafted the core of one fnIII domain (TNfn3) into the homologue
FNfn10, creating a chimera, FNoTNc, which has retained the structure of the
parent proteins. Using several different probes, we have shown that FNoTNc does
not behave like either one of the parent proteins alone. Instead, it has
retained a number of properties of each. We find that each property investigated
clearly resembles the behaviour of one of the parents, enabling us to separate
the contribution of the core and the surface of the protein in determining the
behaviour of the domain. Some of these are unsurprising, such as the pH
dependence of stability, the core side-chain dynamics and the dependence of
folding on the composition of the core. However, the surface of the protein
confers significant stability not only on the native state, but also on the
transition state for folding. Others properties are less predictable. The
surface of the protein confers “plasticity” in peripheral regions of the
proteins as detected by the anomalous response of some regions of the core to
mutation and hydrogen exchange protection patterns.
This suggests that the surface of a domain may have a more significant
coupling with the core than we had previously considered. Since most biophysical
studies tend to focus on the core of a protein, this coupling is a relatively
unexplored area of research.
Materials and Methods
Chemicals
GdmCl was purchased from MP Biomedicals Inc., guanidine isothiocyanate
from Gibco-BRL and urea from BDH Laboratory Supplies.
Protein expression and purification
Site-directed mutagenesis reactions were performed with the QuickChange
kit from Stratagene using the FNoTNc plasmid. The identity of the mutants
was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The mutants studied in this work are listed
in Table 1 and Supplementary Table 1. The nature of the
mutation is indicated with the wild-type residue first (single-letter code),
the position of the mutation second and the mutant residue third. Expression
and purification of FNoTNc and mutants was performed as described earlier
for TNfn3.20
Measurements of protein stability
All biophysical measurements were performed in 50 mM sodium acetate
buffer, pH 5.0 at 25 °C unless otherwise stated. The stability of FNoTNc and
FNoTNc mutants were determined by equilibrium denaturation experiments using
GdmCl and by standard methods using 1 μM protein.20
Kinetic measurements
Kinetics were measured using fluorescence stopped-flow measurements in
50 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, at 25 °C and were monitored by changes
in fluorescence above 320 nm. Refolding measurements for FNoTNc were made in
0 M denaturant by stopped-flow fluorescence using pH jumps from pH 12.4 to
pH 5.0 as previously described.12 (FNoTNc is acid stable.) NaOH (25 mM, pH 12.4) unfolds
FNoTNc completely (data not shown).
Φ-value analysis
Φ values were determined from refolding data at 1.0 M GdmCl, to avoid
the errors associated with long extrapolation, from Eq. (1):43whereand
kfWT and
kfmut are the
rate constants for folding of wild-type and mutant proteins,
respectively.
NMR sample preparation
FNoTNc was expressed and purified by affinity chromatography as
previously described.17 Uniformly 15N labelled and
13C and 15N
labelled samples were expressed in M9 minimal media containing 15NH4Cl and [U-13C]6-glucose as the sole nitrogen and carbon sources. Samples for
side-chain dynamics were expressed as previously described.22
Chemical shift assignments
Backbone assignment experiments were carried out on a double-labelled
(13C, 15N) sample
of FNoTNc, at an approximate concentration of 1–2 mM, in 50 mM imidazole
buffer at pH 7.0 in 10% D2O. Sodium azide (0.05%) was added
to prevent microbial growth. The sample was centrifuged to remove insoluble
protein and degassed. Spectra were acquired at 298 K on a Bruker DRX500
spectrometer with an inverse triple-resonance cryogenic probe. Backbone
assignments were based on HNCACB, HNCO and CBCA(CO)NH experiments together
with the 1H–15N
heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectrum. Side-chain 1H and 13C resonance
assignments were obtained from 3-D HCCH–total correlated spectroscopy
(TOCSY) H(CCCO)NH and (H)CC(CO)NH preceding TOCSY spectra. The spectra were
processed and analysed using NMRpipe and Sparky.44,45 The 1H–15N HSQC has excellent resolution, although resonances from 12
residues in loop regions cannot be detected at either pH 5 or pH 7
(Supplementary Fig. 3 and
Supplementary Table 7).
All samples for side-chain methyl assignment were prepared in 50 mM
sodium acetate buffer at pH 5.0 in 10% D2O, at a
concentration of 1–2 mM. Sodium azide was added to prevent microbial growth.
The sample was centrifuged to remove insoluble protein and degassed. All
experiments were carried out as previously described.22,46,47
Chemical shift assignments of the side chains were made using standard
triple-resonance experiments. Many of the signals in the 1H–13C HSQC are overlapped, meaning
that 5 of the 64 methyl groups in the 1H–13C HSQC could not be assigned with confidence.
Assignment of the leucine and valine methyl groups was made
stereospecifically, based upon the phase of peaks in a 1H–13C HSQC acquired for a sample
with 10% 13C enrichment (Supplementary Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table 7).
Hydrogen exchange
Hydrogen exchange experiments were carried out under EX2 conditions on
a 15N-labelled sample of FNoTNc, at an
approximate concentration of 1–2 mM, in 50 mM imidazole buffer at pD 7.0 in
10% D2O. Sodium azide (0.05%) was added to prevent
microbial growth. The exchange of amide protons was followed by the decay of
intensity of peaks in HSQC spectra.48
The apparent free energy of exchange,
ΔGexapp, was
determined from the rate constant of exchange,
kex, and the intrinsic rate
constant, kint, determined from
peptide data to take account of the primary sequence of the protein and
exchange conditions49,50 using Eq. (2) and
intrinsic rate constants determined using the software Sphere†.51
Backbone 15N relaxation
measurements
Backbone dynamics were determined from 15N
T1 and
T2 relaxation times and the
steady-state heteronuclear 1H15N nuclear Overhauser enhancement at 500 MHz as previously
described.22 The data were analysed using standard protocols for backbone
dynamics with the program TENSOR2.
Side-chain methyl 2H relaxation
measurements
Side-chain deuterium relaxation times
T1(D) and
T1ρ(D) were determined by
measuring the relaxation of the two- and three-spin operator terms,
IzCz,
