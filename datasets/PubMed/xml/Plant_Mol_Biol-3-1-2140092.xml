      <abstract>
        <p>In intact plants, cells in axillary buds are arrested at the G1 phase of the cell cycle during dormancy. In mammalian cells, the cell cycle is suppressed at the G1 phase by the activities of retinoblastoma tumor suppressor gene (<italic>RB</italic>) family proteins, depending on their phosphorylation state. Here, we report the isolation of a pea cDNA clone encoding an RB-related protein (PsRBR1, Accession No. AB012024) with a high degree of amino acid conservation in comparison with RB family proteins. PsRBR1 protein was detected as two polypeptides using an anti-PsRBR1 antibody in dormant axillary buds, whereas it was detected as three polypeptides, which were the same two polypeptides and another larger polypeptide 2&#xA0;h after terminal decapitation. Both in&#xA0;vitro-synthesized PsPRB1 protein and lambda protein phosphatase-treated PsRBR1 protein corresponded to the smallest polypeptide detected by anti-PsRBR1 antibody, suggesting that the three polypeptides correspond to non-phosphorylated form of PsRBR1 protein, and lower- and higher-molecular mass forms of phosphorylated PsRBR1 protein. Furthermore, in&#xA0;vivo labeling with [<sup>32</sup>P]-inorganic phosphate indicated that PsRBR1 protein was more phosphorylated before mRNA accumulation of cell cycle regulatory genes such as <italic>PCNA</italic>. Together these findings suggest that dormancy-to-growth transition in pea axillary buds is regulated by molecular mechanisms of cell cycle control similar to those in mammals, and that the PsRBR1 protein has an important role in suppressing the cell cycle during dormancy in axillary buds.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>In intact plants, the terminal bud predominantly grows, while axillary bud growth is suppressed. This phenomenon is called apical dominance. After terminal bud decapitation, however, the axillary buds grow rapidly and develop in the same manner as the terminal bud. Apical dominance was one of the first developmental phenomena shown to be regulated by plant hormones (Thimann and Skoog <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">1934</xref>). The outgrowth of axillary buds is inhibited by auxin flow from the terminal bud (Booker et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2003</xref>), and is promoted by cytokinin biosynthesized in the stem after decapitation (Tanaka et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2006</xref>). Recently, a variety of experimental approaches were used to examine the molecular mechanisms that control shoot branching (Bennett and Leyser <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2006</xref>; Dun et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2006</xref>; Shimizu-Sato and Mori <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2001</xref>). Some mutants were isolated and characterized in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<italic>max1</italic>, <italic>2</italic>, <italic>3</italic>, and <italic>4</italic>), pea (<italic>rms1</italic>, <italic>2</italic>, <italic>3</italic>, <italic>4</italic>, and <italic>5</italic>), and petunia (<italic>dad1</italic> and <italic>2</italic>). Findings from these molecular genetic approaches combined with conventional physiologic studies, such as grafting experiments, suggested that novel signals regulate axillary bud dormancy. The molecular mechanisms of cell cycle control in axillary buds, however, are still not well understood.</p>
      <p>Most cells in pea axillary buds are arrested at the G1 phase in the cell cycle, and axillary buds have the capacity to undergo multiple cycles of dormancy and growth (Devitt and Stafstrom <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">1995</xref>; Shimizu and Mori <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">1998</xref>). Arrest and progression of the cell cycle in axillary buds are controlled in response to environmental signals and by developmental programs. Thus, we hypothesized that cells in dormant axillary buds are regulated through suppression mechanisms of cell cycle control suppression mechanisms similar to those in mammals.</p>
      <p>In mammals, arrest and progression of the cell cycle are also controlled during the G1 phase in response to environmental signals and by developmental programs (Sherr <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2004</xref>). This process is governed by both positive- and negative-regulatory factors. One of the most important key regulators is the product of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor gene (<italic>RB</italic>). The human <italic>RB</italic> gene encodes a 110-kDa nuclear phosphoprotein (pRB). pRB activities are regulated by phosphorylation in a cell cycle-dependent manner. Phosphorylation states of pRB regulate the interactions of multiple cellular proteins. In the G1 phase, hypo-phosphorylated pRB (hypo-ppRB) binds to a transcriptional factor, E2F family protein, and suppresses its transcriptional activity. E2F family proteins regulate the transcription of several genes (e.g., dihydrofolate reductase, thymidine kinase, DNA polymerase &#x3B1;, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen [<italic>PCNA</italic>]) whose products are required for either G1/S transition or DNA replication. Thus, by negatively regulating E2F family proteins, pRB negatively controls cell cycle progression. pRB is highly phosphorylated by several types of cyclin and cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) complexes in response to environmental signals or developmental programs to progress the cell cycle. E2F family proteins are released from hyper-ppRB and promote the transcription of genes for G1/S transition or DNA replication. Thus, pRB regulates the arrest and progression of the cell cycle based on its phosphorylation state.</p>
      <p>In mammals, there are pRB-related proteins, p130 and p107 (Gra&#xF1;a et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">1998</xref>). RB family proteins regulate the progression of the cell cycle as well as the entry/exit transition of the cell cycle. RB family proteins have the same pocket protein feature; that is, they interact with a multitude of cellular proteins in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. RB family proteins are, however, modulated by differential regulation of phosphorylation states and protein levels in quiescent cells re-entering the cell cycle. In quiescent cells and in cells at the G0/G1 transition, pRB is in a hypo-phosphorylated form, and p130 is detected in non- and low-phosphorylated forms, whereas p107 is not detectable (Lin and DeCaprio <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2003</xref>). In mid-G1/S transition, RB family proteins are phosphorylated by cyclin/CDK complexes. Hypo-ppRB and non- and low-phosphorylated p130 change to hyper-ppRB and high-phosphorylated p130, respectively. p107 is synthesized de novo, followed by phosphorylation to a high-phosphorylated form. Protein levels of pRB remain relatively constant throughout the cell cycle, compared to either p130 or p107. Although there is abundant p130 in the G0/G1 phase, it is dramatically down-regulated in the mid-G1/S phase. p130 down-regulation appears to be mediated by a cell cycle stage-dependent proteasome degradation pathway (Tedesco et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2002</xref>). These observations suggest that RB family proteins have overlapping functions, as well as different functions in the cell cycle regulation of quiescent cells.</p>
      <p>In plants, knowledge of cell cycle control has increased in recent years (Gegas and Doonan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2006</xref>). Some basic mechanisms that regulate the cell cycle appear to have been conserved throughout eukaryotic evolution (Dewitte and Murray <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2003</xref>). To date, plant cDNAs encoding RB-related proteins have been reported in <italic>Zea mays</italic> (Ach et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1997</xref>; Grafi et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">1996</xref>; Xie et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">1996</xref>), <italic>Nicotiana tabacum</italic> (Nakagami et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">1999</xref>), <italic>Chenopodium rubrum</italic> (Fountain et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">1999</xref>), <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (Kong et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2000</xref>), <italic>Populus tremula</italic>&#xA0;&#xD7;&#xA0;<italic>Populus tremuloides</italic> (AF133675), <italic>Cocos nucifera</italic> (AY117036), and <italic>Oryza sativa</italic> (AP004592). The amino acid conservation between animal and plant RB-related proteins suggests that the proteins have similar biochemical properties. Like animal RB family proteins, plant RB-related proteins also interact with various cellular proteins, such as E2F family proteins, D-type cyclin, mammalian viral oncoproteins (SV40 large-T antigen, adenovirus E1a, and HPV E7), and the plant virus proteins (wheat dwarf virus RepA, and the tomato golden mosaic virus replication factor AL1) (Ach et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1997</xref>; Grafi et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">1996</xref>; Huntley et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">1998</xref>; Nakagami et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">1999</xref>; Ramirez-Parra et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">1999</xref>; Sekine et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">1999</xref>; Xie et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">1996</xref>).</p>
      <p>Because the functions of the mammalian RB family proteins depend on their phosphorylation state, the phosphorylation states of plant RB-related proteins were analyzed. ZmRBR1 protein undergoes changes in phosphorylation states concomitant with endoreduplication in maize (Grafi et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">1996</xref>). The human G1/S protein kinases cyclinD/CDK4, cyclinE/CDK2, and cyclinA/CDK2 can phosphorylate ZmRBR1 protein in&#xA0;vitro (Huntley et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">1998</xref>), and NtRBR1 protein is phosphorylated by tobacco cyclinD/CDC2 in&#xA0;vitro (Nakagami et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">1999</xref>). The ZmRBR1 kinase activity correlates with the proliferation state in maize leaf (Boniotti and Gutierrez <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2001</xref>), and NtRBR1 kinase activity is detected only during the mid-G1/S phase in tobacco BY-2 cells (Nakagami et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2002</xref>). These observations also suggest that plant RB-related proteins have biochemical properties similar to those of mammalian RB family proteins. Plant RB-related proteins seem to control not only cell cycle arrest/progression, but also development and cellular differentiation in endosperm, leaf, and root (Ebel et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2004</xref>; Desvoyes et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2006</xref>; Wildwater et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2005</xref>). Only limited information is available, however, on the development-dependent phosphorylation states of plant RB-related protein. In this paper, we describe the isolation and functional characterization of a pea (<italic>Pisum sativum</italic> L. cv. Alaska) cDNA encoding an RB-related protein (PsRBR1), which has biochemical properties similar to those of mammalian RB family proteins. PsRBR1 protein undergoes changes in its phosphorylation state concomitant with dormancy-to-growth transition in pea axillary buds.</p>

Based on the amino acid sequences of reported RB-related proteins, we designed degenerate primers and performed reverse transcription PCR with total RNA prepared from pea shoot apices. Using the amplified DNA fragments as a probe, we screened the cDNA library prepared from pea dormant axillary buds. We obtained 14 positive clones by screening, and partially sequenced their 5&#x2032; ends. The clone that had the longest 5&#x2032; sequence (3540&#xA0;bp) was used for further analysis because the DNA sequences of the other clones corresponded to those of the longest clone. This cDNA contained a single open reading frame capable of encoding a 1026-amino acid residue protein, PsRBR1. The molecular mass of PsRBR1 protein was estimated to be 114-kDa. The <italic>PsRBR1</italic> cDNA contained a stop codon (TAG) four amino acids upstream of the putative initiation methionine codon within the reading frame, indicating that the <italic>PsRBR1</italic> cDNA contained the entire coding region.</p>
        <p>The alignment of the A and B conserved domains and the N-terminal leucine-rich domain of PsRBR1 protein with maize ZmRBR1 protein and human RB family proteins is shown in Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>(A). The A and B conserved domains of the PsRBR1 protein share 43% identity and 71% similarity, respectively with the A and B conserved domains of the ZmRBR1 protein. The conserved cysteine residue corresponding to Cys 706 of human pRB was present as Cys 798 in PsRBR1 protein (shown by an asterisk in the B conserved domain). This conserved cysteine residue is essential for the function of mammalian and plant RB proteins (Ach et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1997</xref>; Grafi et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">1996</xref>; Kaye et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">1990</xref>).

The scheme on the right in Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>(B) shows a diagram of the characteristic features of RB-related proteins. PsRBR1 protein was most similar to <italic>Populus tremula</italic>&#xA0;&#xD7;&#xA0;<italic>Populus tremuloides</italic> PtRBR1 protein. PsRBR1 protein has 16 potential phosphorylation sites (Ser-Pro or Thr-Pro) for CDKs, which are highly clustered in regions flanking the A and B conserved domains. These conserved primary structures strongly suggest that RB-related proteins, including PsRBR1 protein, have similar biochemical properties in plant and animals.</p>
        <p>Genomic Southern blot analyses were performed to estimate the copy number and closely related genes of <italic>PsRBR1</italic> in pea.

        <title>Interactions of PsRBR1 protein with both plant D-type cyclins and a mammalian oncoprotein</title>
        <p>Mammalian and plant RB proteins bind to a large number of cellular and viral proteins, such as D-type cyclin and SV40 large-T antigen. To confirm that PsRBR1 protein acts in the same manner as the mammalian and various plant RB proteins, we tested the ability of PsRBR1 protein to interact with these proteins using a yeast two-hybrid system. The genes for the tested proteins were fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain or the GAL4 activation domain. The data shown in Table&#xA0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> are the averages of three independent transformants. We verified that PsRBR1 protein alone did not activate the reporter gene. PsRBR1 protein interacted with both pea and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> D-type cyclin (Pissa;CycD3;1 and Arath;CycD3;1). Both D-type cyclins contain the canonical RB-binding motif, LXCXE, in their N-terminus (Shimizu and Mori <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">1998</xref>; Soni et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">1995</xref>). PsRBR1 protein interacted with SV40 large-T antigen, which is a mammalian DNA tumor virus oncoprotein. The similarities in primary structures and the coincidence of interacting partners of RB-related proteins suggest that animal and plant RB-related proteins, including PsRBR1 protein, have similar functions in cell cycle regulation.

        <title>Immunochemical detection of PsRBR1 protein in pea axillary buds</title>
        <p>To investigate protein levels and phosphorylation states of PsRBR1 protein in axillary buds during dormancy-to-growth transition, we prepared an anti-PsRBR1 antibody. The specificity of the anti-PsRBR1 antibody against PsRBR1 protein was examined (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A). Protein extracted from growing axillary buds was detected by immunoblotting with the anti-PsRBR1 antibody. The anti-PsRBR1 antibody cross-reacted with three polypeptides (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A, lane 1, filled circle, empty circle, and arrowhead), with molecular masses of approximately 150, 140, and 114-kDa. The pre-immune serum did not cross-react with any polypeptides in the protein extracts (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A, lane 2). The anti-PsRBR1 antibody was incubated with an excess of purified recombinant PsRBR1 protein as a competitor, and then used to detect PsRBR1 protein in pea extract (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A, lane 3). In this case, no polypeptides were detected with the anti-PsRBR1 antibody. These results indicate that the anti-PsRBR1 antibody specifically cross-reacts with PsRBR1 protein in axillary bud extracts.

        <title>Comparison of molecular mass of authentic PsRBR1 protein in pea with that of in&#xA0;vitro-synthesized PsRBR1 protein</title>
        <p>Three polypeptides were detected in protein extracts from pea axillary buds by immunoblotting with the anti-PsRBR1 antibody. The molecular mass of PsRBR1 protein was estimated to be 114-kDa based on the deduced amino acid sequences of <italic>PsRBR1</italic> cDNA. To clarify these differences in the molecular mass of PsRBR1 protein, we compared the molecular mass of authentic PsRBR1 protein in pea with that of in&#xA0;vitro-synthesized PsRBR1 protein (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B). PsRBR1 protein was synthesized using an in&#xA0;vitro-coupled transcription-translation system with [<sup>35</sup>S]-methionine. In&#xA0;vitro-synthesized PsRBR1 protein produced a major 114-kDa polypeptide (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B, lane 2, arrowhead). The molecular mass of the PsRBR1 protein was consistent with that predicted from the deduced amino acid sequences of <italic>PsRBR1</italic> cDNA.

The 114-kDa polypeptide was immunoprecipitated with the anti-PsRBR1 antibody, indicating that in&#xA0;vitro-synthesized PsRBR1 protein is 114-kDa and corresponds to the smallest polypeptide detected by anti-PsRBR1 antibody in growing axillary buds (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B, lane 4). These results suggested that the smallest polypeptide (114-kDa) detected by the anti-PsRBR1 antibody was non-modified PsRBR1 protein in axillary buds, and the two larger polypeptides of PsRBR1 proteins were modified by post-translational regulation in axillary buds.</p>

        <title>Dephosphorylation of authentic PsRBR1 protein</title>
        <p>The activity of mammalian RB family proteins is regulated by their phosphorylation states. Plant RB-related proteins are also phosphorylated by cyclin/CDK complexes (Huntley et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">1998</xref>; Nakagami et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">1999</xref>). PsRBR1 protein has some putative CDK phosphorylation sites (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B). Thus, we expected that the modification of authentic PsRBR1 protein in the axillary buds caused its phosphorylation. To examine this, we performed in&#xA0;vitro dephosphorylation reactions against PsRBR1 protein using (&#x3BB;-PPase. Proteins were separated by two types of SDS-PAGE gels, because some phosphorylated proteins were more clearly separated by low bis-acrylamide gel (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>C, right) than by standard acrylamide gel (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>C, left) (Iwasaki et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2002</xref>). Immunoblotting with anti-PsRBR1 antibody indicated that there were three polypeptides corresponding to PsRBR1 protein in growing axillary buds (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>C, lane 1), but after &#x3BB;-PPase treatment of the protein extract, PsRBR1 protein was detected as the smallest of the polypeptides (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>C, lane 3). On the other hand, the molecular mass of PsRBR1 protein did not change after treatment without &#x3BB;-PPase added to the protein extract as a negative control (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>C, lane 2). In addition, the low bis-acrylamide gel separated the protein more clearly than did the standard acrylamide gel. These results suggested that PsRBR1 protein was controlled by post-translational modification, and exists in non-phosphorylated form of PsRBR1 protein, lower-molecular mass form of phosphorylated PsRBR1 protein (Lp-form), and higher-molecular mass form of phosphorylated PsRBR1 protein (Hp-form) in growing axillary buds.</p>

        <title>Protein levels and phosphorylation states of PsRBR1 protein in axillary buds during dormancy-to-growth transition</title>
        <p>Because suppression of the cell cycle is regulated by the phosphorylation states of mammalian RB family proteins, we evaluated the phosphorylation states of PsRBR1 during dormancy-to-growth transition in pea axillary buds by immunoblotting using the anti-PsRBR1 antibody (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A). During dormancy, PsRBR1 protein was detected as two polypeptides, which are non-phosphorylated form of PsRBR1 protein and the Lp-form (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A, 0&#xA0;h after decapitation). In addition to these non-phosphorylated form of PsRBR1 protein and the Lp-form, the Hp-form was detected 2&#xA0;h after decapitation (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A, indicated by the arrow). These results suggested that PsRBR1 protein was shifted from non-phosphorylated form of PsRBR1 protein and the Lp-form to the Hp-form; that is, the PsRBR1 protein was more phosphorylated after decapitation. The protein levels of these three polypeptides were increased 12&#xA0;h after decapitation. Non-phosphorylated PsRBR1 protein and the Lp-form existed during late stage (12 to 24&#xA0;h) after decapitation. <italic>PsRBR1</italic> mRNA level was increased 12&#xA0;h after decapitation (see Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B). It seems that non-phosphorylated PsRBR1 protein and the Lp-form were synthesized and phosphorylated de novo after decapitation. Moreover, because the axillary bud cell cycle is not completely synchronized, the non-phosphorylated PsRBR1 protein and the Lp-form were included in the protein extracts prepared from growing axillary buds.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In intact plants, the pea shoot apex inhibits growth; i.e., cell elongation and cell division of the dormant axillary buds. The cell cycle of dormant axillary buds is arrested at the G1 phase. Therefore, from the point of view of cell cycle control, the transition from dormancy to outgrowth in axillary buds seems to be from the G1 phase to the S phase. In animal cells, RB family proteins function as negative controllers in G1 arrest, and the activities of RB family proteins are controlled by their phosphorylation states. Here, we investigated phosphorylation states of the pea RB-related protein, PsRBR1, during the dormancy-to-growth transition in axillary buds. The results of the present study provide a basis for further studies of the molecular mechanisms underlying apical dominance and cell cycle control.</p>
      <p>Mammalian and plant RB proteins have several highly conserved regions, which are the N-terminal leucine rich, A and B conserved domains, multiple potential CDK phosphorylation sites, and a conserved cysteine residue. PsRBR1 protein, like other plant RB-related proteins, has the ability to interact with both plant D-type cyclins and a mammalian oncoprotein. Plant RB-related proteins have the same properties and activities as animal RB family proteins. For example, ZmRBR1 protein binds to human and Drosophila E2F, and inhibits transcriptional activation of human E2F (Huntley et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">1998</xref>; Ramirez-Parra et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">1999</xref>; Sekine et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">1999</xref>). Geminivirus DNA replication is reduced in plant cells transfected with plasmids encoding human p130 (Xie et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">1996</xref>). Human cyclinD/CDKA phosphorylates NtRBR1 protein in&#xA0;vitro (Nakagami et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">1999</xref>). Thus, plant RB-related proteins can function not only as plant factors, but also as animal factors. These results strongly suggest that the functions of plant RB-related proteins, including PsRBR1 protein, are similar to those of the mammalian RB family proteins in G1/S transition, and that plant and animal cells might use similar regulatory proteins and pathways for cell cycle control during the G1 phase. Therefore, the maintenance of this high degree of similarity throughout evolution (in plants, insects, and vertebrates), further emphasizes the critical roles of RB-related proteins.</p>
      <p>Three human RB family proteins (pRB, p130, and p107) have individual functions in cell cycle regulation and development. Two RB-related genes were isolated from <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. To date, plant RB-related proteins have been reported in <italic>Zea mays</italic>, <italic>Nicotiana tabacum</italic>, <italic>Chenopodium rubrum</italic>, <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, <italic>Populus tremula</italic> x <italic>Populus tremuloides</italic>, <italic>Cocos nunucifera</italic>, and <italic>Oryza sativa</italic> (Ach et&#xA0;al. 1997; Fountain et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">1999</xref>; Grafi et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">1996</xref>; Kong et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2000</xref>; Nakagami et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">1999</xref>; Xie et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">1996</xref>). Of these, <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> and <italic>Oryza sativa</italic> might contain only one copy of the <italic>RB</italic>-related gene in the whole genome based on the similarity of amino acid sequences of RB-related proteins. Here, our genomic Southern blot analysis suggested the presence of only one copy of the <italic>PsRBR1</italic> gene in pea. The dicot <italic>RB</italic>-related gene seems to contain only one copy in the genome. By contrast, maize contains at least three <italic>RB</italic>-related genes. ZmRBR3 protein also functions to promote endosperm development (Sabelli et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2005</xref>), suggesting that maize RB family proteins have special roles in endosperm development.</p>
      <p>When the protein extracts in growing axillary buds were treated with &#x3BB;-PPase, the Lp- and Hp-forms should have been dephopshorylated and stoichiometrically shifted to non-phosphorylated forms. As shown in Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>(C), however, it appears that there was no increase in the non-phosphorylated form (lane 3) compared to the other lanes. The reason for this might be that a 40-kDa polypeptide was also detected by immunoblotting with the anti-PsRBR1 antibody (data not shown). The 40-kDa polypeptide was probably derived from in&#xA0;vitro-dephosphorylated PsRBR1 protein by degradation during &#x3BB;-PPase treatment. In&#xA0;vitro-dephosphorylated PsRBR1 protein might be more unstable than in&#xA0;vivo-dephosphorylated PsRBR1 protein, despite the presence of proteinase inhibitors, though the reason for this is not clear.</p>
      <p>The results of the immunoblotting experiments indicated that the migration patterns of mammalian RB family proteins differ depending on their phosphorylation states. According to the reports (Farkas et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2002</xref>), the faster migrating proteins were the non- and hypo-phosphorylated forms in the G0/G1 phases. The slower migrating protein was the hyper-phosphorylated form during the G1/S transition. In plant, immunoblotting with the anti-ZmRBR1 antibody revealed the ZmRBR1 protein to be a diffuse protein band of approximately 110-kDa during endoreduplication in maize endosperm, and there are some polypeptides of approximately 110-kDa in maize leaf (Grafi et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">1996</xref>; Huntley et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">1998</xref>). The diffused protein bands of ZmRBR1 were confirmed by the use of &#x3BB;-phosphatase to result from phosphorylation. (Grafi et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">1996</xref>). In the present paper, using &#x3BB;-PPase treatment and in&#xA0;vivo labeling followed by immunoprecipitation with the anti-PsRBR1 antibody, we showed that PsRBR1 protein exists in three phosphorylated forms in axillary buds. Although we could not determine the number of phosphorylation sites in the Lp- and Hp-forms, the Lp- and Hp-forms might correspond to the hypo- and hyper-phosphorylated forms of PsRBR1 protein, respectively.</p>
      <p>Plant E2F isolated from tobacco and wheat has transcriptional activity and interacts with RB-related protein (Ramirez-Parra et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">1999</xref>; Sekine et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">1999</xref>). There are E2F-binding sites in the promoter region of <italic>PCNA</italic>, whose transcripts are induced in the late-G1/S phase (Kodama et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">1991</xref>). These observations suggest that plant E2F, like that in animal, induces gene expression of <italic>PCNA</italic>. Further phosphorylation of PsRBR1 protein was induced 2&#xA0;h after terminal bud decapitation, and <italic>PCNA</italic> transcripts were induced 4&#xA0;h after terminal bud decapitation in pea axillary buds. Although it is unclear whether the transcriptional activation of plant <italic>PCNA</italic> is regulated by E2F, E2F released from RB-related protein might promote <italic>PCNA</italic> mRNA expression, as in mammals. This possibility is supported by the observation that ZmRBR1-associated kinase activity peaks at the G1/S transition in synchronized tobacco BY-2 cells (Boniotti and Gutierrez <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2001</xref>). It is likely that increased phosphorylation states of PsRBR1 protein have an important role in the regulation of E2F-mediated gene expression involved in the G1/S transition and DNA replication during dormancy-to-growth transition in pea axillary buds.</p>
      <p>In some plants, the gene expression of cyclins and CDK activities are regulated by plant hormones, e.g., cytokinin, auxin, and gibberellin (Miao et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">1993</xref>; Sauter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">1997</xref>; Soni et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">1995</xref>). In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> suspension-cultured cells, <italic>D-type cyclin</italic> mRNA is rapidly induced by the addition of cytokinin or glucose, and repressed by the addition of auxin (Soni et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">1995</xref>). Cytokinin is biosynthesized at the stem after decapitation and moves into the axillary buds for outgrowth (Tanaka et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2006</xref>). It is possible that the increasing cytokinin levels caused by decapitation induces the expression of <italic>D-type cyclin</italic>. D-type cyclin forms a complex with CDKs and immediately phosphorylates RB-related protein. The Hp-form induces gene expression for the G1/S transition in axillary bud cells. It is likely that RB-related protein controls the cell cycle in axillary buds during the dormancy-to-growth transition. Further analyses will provide more insight into the regulation of dormancy-to-growth transition in axillary buds.</p>
