          <title>BACKGROUND</title>
          <p>Successful blastocyst implantation requires the differentiation of human endometrial stromal cells (HESC), a process known as decidualization. Activin A, a transforming growth factor &#x3B2; (TGF&#x3B2;) superfamily member, enhances HESC decidualization and localizes to decidual cells in human endometrium. Other TGF&#x3B2; superfamily members, including BMP2, BMP4, BMP7, GDF5, GDF8, GDF11, TGF&#x3B2;s and Nodal, may also play a role during decidualization. This study aimed to identify these TGF&#x3B2; family members in human endometrium, and to determine whether they are involved in human decidualization.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec sec-type="methods">
          <title>METHODS</title>
          <p>Protein localization of TGF&#x3B2; family members was examined in secretory phase human endometrium and first trimester decidua by immunohistochemistry. mRNA expression was examined in HESC. Activin inhibitors (Activin-M108A/SB431542) with differing specificities for the other TGF&#x3B2; members under consideration were applied during HESC decidualization <italic>in vitro</italic>. The secretion levels of potential TGF&#x3B2; superfamily members were measured during decidualization, and recombinant proteins added to examine their effect.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>RESULTS</title>
          <p>This study has identified BMP2, BMP4, BMP7, GDF5, GDF8 and GDF11 but not Nodal in secretory phase human endometrium, but only BMP2, GDF5 and TGF&#x3B2;1 protein were detected in decidual cells. All ligands except Nodal were expressed by cultured HESC. Both inhibitors significantly reduced decidualization validating the role of activin, but potentially also other TGF&#x3B2; members, during decidualization. BMP2 and TGF&#x3B2;1 secretion increased during HESC decidualisation and exogenous administration of these proteins significantly enhanced decidualization <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
          <p>Like activin, BMP2 and TGF&#x3B2;1 are likely to be involved in HESC decidualization. This is the first study to identify and localize BMP4, BMP7, GDF5, GDF8 and GDF11 in secretory phase human endometrium. Understanding the factors critical for the implantation process is needed for improving fertility and pregnancy outcomes.</p>

  <body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Throughout each menstrual cycle the human endometrium undergoes morphological and physiological changes, in preparation for pregnancy should the cycle include conception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN110C30">Loke <italic>et al</italic>., 1995</xref>). An absolute requirement for successful implantation is the differentiation and proliferation of endometrial stromal cells into enlarged, phenotypically different decidual cells, a process termed endometrial decidualization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN110C49">Tang <italic>et al</italic>., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN110C45">Salamonsen <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>). This process is initiated near the spiral arterioles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN110C2">Bell, 1991</xref>), and occurs under the influence of progesterone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN110C42">Psychoyos, 1973</xref>), although cAMP appears to be essential for priming the endometrial stromal cells to the actions of progesterone; hence both pathways are absolutely required for decidualization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN110C13">Gellersen and Brosens, 2003</xref>). It is now clear that the decidualization response is mediated by a complex array of bioactive molecules, including IL-11, prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub>, relaxin and activins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN110C10">Frank <italic>et al</italic>., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN110C44">Robb <italic>et al</italic>., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN110C23">Jones <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN110C6">Dimitriadis <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>).</p><p>The transforming growth factor &#x3B2; (TGF&#x3B2;) superfamily is a large family of proteins that encompasses the sub-families TGF&#x3B2;s, activins, bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) and growth differentiation factors (GDFs). Overall, this superfamily of proteins exhibits functional diversity, with biological roles in cell differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis and tissue remodelling, all consistent with various reproductive processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN110C24">Jones <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Activins consist of two &#x3B2; subunits, &#x3B2;A and &#x3B2;B, that homo/heterodimerize to form activin A, activin B and activin AB, respectively. The activin &#x3B2; subunits are produced in the glandular epithelium during the proliferative and secretory phases, but in stromal cells only following decidualization during the mid-late secretory phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN110C39">Otani <italic>et al</italic>., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN110C22">Jones <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN110C36">Mylonas <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>). High levels of dimeric activin A are secreted by cAMP-treated endometrial stromal cells. Addition of activin A to decidualizing cells <italic>in vitro</italic> significantly increased the secretion of prolactin (PRL) and IGFBP-1 (decidual cell markers), suggesting activin A drives decidualization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN110C23">Jones <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN110C50">Tierney and Giudice, 2004</xref>). This decidualization response can be neutralized by follistatin, the naturally occurring activin antagonist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN110C23">Jones <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN110C50">Tierney and Giudice, 2004</xref>).

In pregnant mice the temporospatial localization of BMPs 2, 4, 6 and 7 suggested roles during pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN110C53">Ying and Zhao, 2000</xref>). BMP2 is present within the decidual area at implantation sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN110C53">Ying and Zhao, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN110C29">Li <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>) and plays a role in decidualization <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN110C29">Li <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). Importantly, conditional ablation of uterine BMP2 in mice resulted in ineffective decidualization and disrupted pregnancy outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN110C28">Lee <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). In a human model of endometrial stromal cell (HESC) decidualization <italic>in vitro</italic>, BMP2 mRNA increased during decidualization and addition of BMP2 to cultures accelerated PRL mRNA expression (a measure of the extent of decidualization). BMP2 protein has not been examined <italic>in vivo</italic> in human endometrial tissue. The only GDFs identified in the uterus are GDF9 and GDF10, detected by northern analysis in both human and mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN110C4">Cunningham <italic>et al</italic>., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN110C9">Fitzpatrick <italic>et al</italic>., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN110C54">Zhao <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>): no studies have shown GDF proteins.</p><p>TGF&#x3B2; isoforms (1&#x2013;3), which cannot bind follistatin, have also been localized in human endometrial stroma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN110C24">Jones <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>), although it is not clear whether any isoform is specific to decidualized cells or increases as the cells decidualize. The TGF&#x3B2;s transmit signal through the TGF&#x3B2; type I, II and III receptors, all of which are present on endometrial stromal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN110C3">Chegini <italic>et al</italic>., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN110C7">Dumont <italic>et al</italic>., 1995</xref>). Microarray studies have demonstrated increases in both TGF&#x3B2;1 and TGF&#x3B2;2 mRNA with HESC decidualization <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN110C41">Popovici <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN110C51">Tierney <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>), while in women treated with medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) for 10 days, stromal mRNA and protein increased for TGF&#x3B2;3 but not TGF&#x3B2;1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN110C43">Reis <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>). Whether the TGF&#x3B2;s play a functional role during human decidualization remains unknown.</p><p>Given that the TGF&#x3B2; superfamily of proteins are such common and crucial differentiative and proliferative factors, it is surprising that very few members of the family, including the GDFs and BMPs, have been examined in the human endometrium, particularly in the mid-secretory phase when differentiation of stromal cells is initiated. The high level of redundancy between TGF&#x3B2; family members and the promiscuity of receptor&#x2013;ligand interactions would suggest that it is likely that a number of other family members are involved in decidualization and in the other processes occurring in this highly dynamic tissue.</p><p>In this study, the presence of BMPs (BMP2, BMP4, BMP7), GDFs (GDF5, GDF8/Myostatin, GDF11), Nodal and TGF&#x3B2;s were examined <italic>in vivo</italic> by immunohistochemistry in secretory phase endometrial tissue, and <italic>in vitro</italic> for mRNA expression in both non-decidualized and decidualized HESC. Inhibitors with different specificities were administered to HESC to elucidate whether activin is the major family member driving decidualization or whether other family groupings (BMPs, GDFs, TGF&#x3B2;s) might equally contribute to the process. As these are secreted factors, individual ligands were measured in conditioned medium from non-decidualized and decidualized HESC to assess whether they increased with decidualization. The effect of the secreted ligands on decidualization was also examined.

Some glands had punctate staining for BMP2 (Fig.&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DEN110F1">1</xref>C), but BMP2 was most strongly stained in decidual cells in mid-late secretory endometrium (Fig.&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DEN110F1">1</xref>D).

However, in first trimester placenta, BMP4 was reduced in the decidual cells, but strongly produced by the glandular epithelium (Fig.&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DEN110F1">1</xref>N, inset). BMP7 was detected in the stroma and not in the glands in mid-late secretory endometrium (Fig.&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DEN110F1">1</xref>O).

In addition, the current study has immunolocalized BMP2, TGF&#x3B2;1 and GDF5 protein to decidualized stromal cells, and provided further evidence for a role for secreted activin, BMP2 and TGF&#x3B2;1 in decidualization through the use of novel inhibitors and a well-established <italic>ex vivo</italic> decidualization model.</p><p>Decidualization of endometrial stromal cells is a pivotal event in the preparation for blastocyst implantation. Although this process is governed by hormonal regulation, it is becomingly increasingly evident that a multitude of factors, including cytokines and growth factors, are essential in ensuring this process occurs successfully such that endometrial stromal cells are differentiated into the implantation-favourable decidual cells. The identification of BMP2, TGF&#x3B2;1 and GDF5 protein in mid-secretory human endometrial tissue, together with the increased secretion of both BMP2 and TGF&#x3B2;1 from stromal cells following decidualization, suggests these TGF&#x3B2; family members are hormonally regulated and important for decidualization.</p><p>The finding that BMP2 secretion from HESC increases as they decidualize <italic>in vitro</italic> and that addition of rhBMP2 further drives decidualization as determined by secretion of PRL, extends the recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN110C29">Li <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>), which showed an increase of BMP2 mRNA with decidualization in a similar model and of PRL mRNA following treatment of HESC with rhBMP2. This is important given that translation and secretion do not necessarily follow increases in mRNA. The inhibitor M108A which acts primarily on those ligands acting through the activin type 11 receptor (Table&#xA0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="DEN110TB1">I</xref>) is not known to block the action of BMP2 which acts through the BMP type II receptor (BMPRII). Therefore, the inability of M108A to fully block the decidualization process suggests that factors other than activins and GDFs are likely to be important to this process: BMP2 is a likely candidate.</p><p>Interestingly in mice, uterine-specific conditional ablation of BMP2 resulted in uterine stromal disruption and an inability to undergo normal decidual reactions and pregnancy progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN110C28">Lee <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). Our demonstration of BMP2 in human endometrium <italic>in vivo</italic> with the strongest immunostaining in decidualized cells in the mid-late secretory phase and in the decidua of early pregnancy, confirms the biological relevance in women. Given this data in conjunction with our functional studies of human decidualization, there appears to be little doubt that BMP2 is an important mediator of both mouse and human decidualization.</p><p>This study also demonstrates, for the first time, the presence of GDF5 in human endometrium and first trimester placenta where it is intensely and specifically stained in the decidual cells. GDF5 is best known for its role in early chondrogenesis and joint formation, being involved in inducing cartilage differentiation, growth and maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN110C34">Mikic, 2004</xref>), as well as bone formation and angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN110C52">Yamashita <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>). Differentiation and angiogenesis are the main events of decidualization. Unfortunately, assays for GDF5 were not available to measure the secretion from decidualized cells. The decrease in decidualization seen following administration of M108A was not likely to be due to GDF5 blockade, as this ligand has a relatively low, if any, affinity for the activin type II receptor. Future studies should address whether GDF5 has a functional role in decidualization, whether it be in promoting differentiation or in the formation of associated blood vessels to support the blastocyst in early pregnancy and throughout gestation.</p><p>Although the TGF&#x3B2;s have been previously detected in the human endometrium, the information regarding their role during decidualization is contentious, as studies report contrasting effects on PRL production by endometrial stroma and during decidualization <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN110C27">Kubota <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN110C25">Kim <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). We showed here that under serum-free conditions, TGF&#x3B2;1 secretion increases during cAMP-induced decidualization <italic>in vitro</italic>. Microarray studies have likewise shown increased TGF&#x3B2;1 and TGF&#x3B2;2 mRNA when cAMP or progesterone is used as decidual stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN110C41">Popovici <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN110C51">Tierney <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>). The protein for both isoforms localizes to stromal cells in human endometrium throughout the menstrual cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN110C16">Gold <italic>et al</italic>., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN110C15">Godkin and Dore, 1998</xref>), although decidualized stromal cells were not shown. In contrast, the present study identified TGF&#x3B2;1 protein in decidualized stromal cells in human endometrium, and its secretion increased in cAMP-decidualized HESC. Administration of SB431542, which effectively blocks the TGF&#x3B2;s as well as activins by blocking their structurally similar ALK5 and ALK4 receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN110C21">Inman <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>), resulted in a 77% reduction in decidualization, a greater decrease than that seen with M108A (this study) and follistatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN110C50">Tierney and Giudice, 2004</xref>). This, along with our demonstration that addition of TGF&#x3B2;1 during progesterone-induced decidualization enhances decidualization, provides convincing evidence to suggest TGF&#x3B2;1 is important during decidualization. The level of activated TGF&#x3B2;2 was undetectable by ELISA in cAMP-decidualized endometrial stromal cells, and therefore this ligand is unlikely to contribute to the decidual response.</p><p>The identification of BMP4, BMP7, GDF8 and GDF11 during the mid-secretory phase is also an important finding. In addition to decidualization, there are many remodelling processes occurring in the endometrium during this time. Both BMP4 and GDF8 protein showed intense immunolocalization to the cytoplasm of the stroma, irrespective of whether or not the cells were decidualized. This was verified for BMP4 by the minimal difference in secretion levels between non-decidualized and decidualized cells <italic>in vitro</italic>. BMP4 mRNA expression has been localized to the vascular endothelial cells in pregnant mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN110C53">Ying and Zhao, 2000</xref>), and in the non-pregnant rat uterus, where it is constitutively expressed throughout the cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN110C8">Erickson <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>). This differs to the localization of BMP4 protein shown here in human endometrium. It may be that the mRNA localized to blood vessels in the rodent studies is not translated into functional protein.</p><p>GDF8 (more commonly referred to as Myostatin) is a negative regulator of skeletal muscle, but more recently has been shown to be involved in glucose metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN110C32">McPherron and Lee, 2002</xref>), particularly in placenta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN110C35">Mitchell <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). This study verified the presence of GDF8 protein in first trimester placenta, and showed for the first time its presence in secretory phase endometrium and in HESC. Given the lack of specific decidual staining it is unlikely that the response from M108A inhibitor was due to blocking GDF8 in HESC, even though the predominant receptor for GDF8 is the activin type II receptor. The presence of GDF8 in non-muscular tissue and organs is rare and future experiments should determine whether it has a role in endometrial biology as it does throughout gestation in the placenta.</p><p>Vesicular staining for BMP7 (or Osteogenic protein-1; OP-1) was evident in highly decidualized cells during the secretory phase of human endometrium with minimal staining in selected glandular and luminal epithelial cells. OP-1 has been identified in the uterine epithelium of non-pregnant mice and rat uterus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN110C40">Ozkaynak <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN110C8">Erickson <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>), with localization remaining unchanged across the cycle. In pregnant mice, however, BMP7 mRNA was detected in the decidualizing stromal cells surrounding the blastocyst with no staining in the epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN110C53">Ying and Zhao, 2000</xref>). In the present study, BMP7 secretion from HESC was undetectable by ELISA, making it difficult to assess whether it may have a functional role during decidualization.</p><p>In conclusion, this study has identified that a wide range of TGF&#x3B2; ligands are present in mid-late secretory human endometrium but of these, in addition to activins, only BMP2, GDF5 and TGF&#x3B2;1 increase in stromal cells as they undergo decidualization. BMP2 and TGF&#x3B2;1, along with activins, are important in driving the decidualization process. Functions for the remaining ligands remain to be determined but they are likely to participate in the extensive tissue remodelling that occurs in this highly dynamic tissue as it prepares for blastocyst implantation and pregnancy.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Supplementary material</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://humrep.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/den110/DC1">Supplementary material is available at <italic>HUMREP</italic> Journal online</ext-link></p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Funding</title><p>This work was funded by the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia (#241000, #388901) and a Prince Henry's Institute Postgraduate Scholarship.</p></sec>
