      <abstract>
        <p>Extracellular nucleotides mediate glia-to-neuron signalling in the retina and are implicated in the volume regulation of retinal glial (M&#xFC;ller) cells under osmotic stress conditions. We investigated the expression and functional role of ectonucleotidases in M&#xFC;ller cells of the rodent retina by cell-swelling experiments, calcium imaging, and immuno- and enzyme histochemistry. The swelling of M&#xFC;ller cells under hypoosmotic stress was inhibited by activation of an autocrine purinergic signalling cascade. This cascade is initiated by exogenous glutamate and involves the consecutive activation of P2Y<sub>1</sub> and adenosine A1 receptors, the action of ectoadenosine 5&#x2032;-triphosphate (ATP)ases, and a nucleoside-transporter-mediated release of adenosine. Inhibition of ectoapyrases increased the ATP-evoked calcium responses in M&#xFC;ller cell endfeet. M&#xFC;ller cells were immunoreactive for nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolases (NTPDase)2 (but not NTPDase1), ecto-5&#x2032;-nucleotidase, P2Y<sub>1</sub>, and A1 receptors. Enzyme histochemistry revealed that ATP but not adenosine 5&#x2032;-diphosphate (ADP) is extracellularly metabolised in retinal slices of NTPDase1 knockout mice. NTPDase1 activity and protein is restricted to blood vessels, whereas activity of alkaline phosphatase is essentially absent at physiological pH. The data suggest that NTPDase2 is the major ATP-degrading ectonucleotidase of the retinal parenchyma. NTPDase2 expressed by M&#xFC;ller cells can be implicated in the regulation of purinergic calcium responses and cellular volume.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Glial cells play an active role in the regulation of neuronal activity. By release of so-called gliotransmitters, in particular glutamate and adenosine 5&#x2032;-triphosphate (ATP), activated glial cells provide both excitatory and inhibitory effects on neighbouring neurons. Excitation is mediated predominantly by glutamate, whereas ATP, after extracellular conversion to adenosine, causes neuronal suppression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In the neural retina, stimulation of M&#xFC;ller glial cells by receptor agonists such as ATP, dopamine and thrombin, or electrical and mechanical stimuli, triggers intracellular calcium responses associated with a release of ATP from the cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. It has been suggested that ATP released from M&#xFC;ller cells is extracellularly converted to adenosine, which in turn activates A1 receptors in a subset of retinal ganglion cells, resulting in cellular hyperpolarisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In addition to the involvement in glia-to-neuron signalling, glia-derived nucleotides in the retina have autocrine effects. ATP released from retinal glial cells and subsequent activation of purinergic receptors evokes long-range calcium waves in the glial cell network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and inhibits the swelling of M&#xFC;ller cells under conditions of osmotic stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p>
      <p>Extracellular metabolism of ATP has been implicated in the glia-to-neuron signalling in the retina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. It is known that M&#xFC;ller cells express ecto-5&#x2032;-nucleotidase (CD73) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], at least during the period of postnatal vasculogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. CD73 hydrolyses nucleoside monophosphates such as AMP to the respective nucleosides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, it is unclear whether M&#xFC;ller cells also express ectoenzymes that degrade ATP, such as nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolases (NTPDases) or ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterases (ENPPs). NTPDase1 (CD39, ectoapyrase) and NTPDase2 (CD39L1, ecto-ATPase), as well as NTPDases 3 and 8, are capable of hydrolysing nucleoside 5&#x2032;-tri- and diphosphates such as ATP and ADP, albeit with considerably different substrate preference. Whereas NTPDase1 hydrolyses ATP and ADP about equally well, NTPDase2 preferentially degrades ATP, and NTPDases 3 and 8 reveal intermediate substrate preferences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In the neural retina, ADPase enzyme histochemistry and CD39 immunohistochemistry allocated NTPDase1 exclusively to the vasculature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In the brain, NTPDase1 is associated with microvessels and microglial cells but not with neurons or astrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. NTPDase2 is expressed in the germinal zones of the developing and adult brain and by subpial astrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In the peripheral nervous system, NTPDase1 is expressed by blood vessels and NTPDase2 by various types of glial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. ENPP1 is an ectoenzyme with both 5&#x2032;-nucleotide phosphodiesterase and nucleotide pyrophosphatase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. It is expressed in cell lines derived from brain glial cells and has also been allocated to brain capillaries and synaptosomal plasma membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The aim of our study was to investigate whether extracellular nucleotide metabolism is implicated in the inhibitory effect of ATP on the osmotic swelling of M&#xFC;ller cells, to determine the types of ectonucleotidases expressed by M&#xFC;ller cells and whether the retinal expression of ectonucleotidases is altered after transient retinal ischaemia reperfusion.</p>

        <p>All experiments were performed in accordance with the European Communities Council Directive 86/609/EEC and were approved by the local authorities. Adult Long-Evans rats (250&#x2013;350&#xA0;g), NTPDase1 (<italic>cd39</italic>)-deficient mice, and wild-type mice were used. The generation of NTPDase1-deficient mice from wild-type animals has been described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Animals had free access to water and food in an air-conditioned room on a 12-h light&#x2013;dark cycle. Transient retinal ischaemia was induced in one eye of the rats, whereas the other eye remained untreated and served as control (three animals). Anaesthesia was induced by intramuscular ketamine (100&#xA0;mg/kg) and xylazine(5&#xA0;mg/kg). The anterior chamber of the treated eye was cannulated from the pars plana with a 27-gauge infusion needle connected to a bag containing normal saline. The intraocular pressure was increased to 160&#xA0;mmHg for 60&#xA0;min by elevating the saline bag. The animals were killed by carbon dioxide 3&#xA0;days after reperfusion, and the eyes were removed.</p>

        <title>M&#xFC;ller cell swelling</title>
        <p>To determine volume changes of M&#xFC;ller glial cells evoked by hypotonic stress, the somata of the cells in the inner nuclear layer of rat retinal slices were recorded. Acutely isolated slices (thickness, 1&#xA0;mm) were placed in a perfusion chamber and loaded with the vital dye Mitotracker Orange (10&#xA0;&#x3BC;M). This dye is selectively taken up by M&#xFC;ller cells, whereas retinal neurons, astrocytes and microglial cells remain unstained [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The stock solution of the dye was prepared in dimethylsulfoxide and resolved in saline. The slices were examined with a confocal laser scanning microscope (LSM) LSM 510 Meta (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Mitotracker Orange was excited at 543&#xA0;nm, and emission was recorded with a 560&#xA0;nm long-pass filter. In the course of the experiments, the somata of M&#xFC;ller cells were recorded at the plane of their maximal extension.</p>
        <p>A gravity-fed system with multiple reservoirs was used to perfuse the recording chamber continuously with extracellular solution; the hypotonic solution and test substances were added by rapidly changing the perfusate. The extracellular solution consisted of (mM) 136 NaCl, 3 KCl, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 hydroxyethylpiperazine ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) and 11 glucose, adjusted to pH 7.4 with Tris. The hypotonic solution (60% of control osmolarity) was made up by adding distilled water. Barium chloride was added to the extracellular solution and was preincubated for 10&#xA0;min. Blocking substances were preincubated for 15&#x2013;45&#xA0;min, and agonists were administered simultaneously with the hypotonic solution.</p>

After 10&#xA0;min of washing by continuous perfusion of extracellular solution, ATP was added by a fast change of the perfusate. ARL-67156 was preincubated for 25&#xA0;min.

        <p>Mice were deeply anaesthetised with pentobarbital (800&#xA0;mg/kg) and perfused intracardially with phosphate-buffered saline containing heparin (0.5&#xA0;mg/ml) followed by 0.05&#xA0;M cacodylate-buffered 4% paraformaldehyde, pH 7.4. Subsequently, eyes were removed and immersed at 4&#xB0;C in the same fixative for 4&#xA0;h. The eyes were cryoprotected overnight with 30% sucrose and frozen in isopentane at &#x2212;80&#xB0;C. Frozen tissues were stored at &#x2212;80&#xB0;C until sectioning. Frozen sections (14&#xA0;&#x3BC;m) were deposited on 3-aminopropyl-triethoxysilane-coated slides and allowed to dry for 1&#xA0;h. The dry sections were stored at &#x2212;80&#xB0;C until further processing. For localisation of ectonucleotidase activity, a lead phosphate method was applied, as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In brief, frozen sections were warmed to room temperature. The enzyme reaction was performed for 1&#xA0;h at room temperature in a TMS-buffered substrate solution (in mM: 2 Pb(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, 5 MnCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 50 Tris-maleate, pH 7.4, plus 0.25&#xA0;M sucrose) stabilised with 3% dextran T 250 (Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany) containing the substrates ATP, ADP or pNPP (sodium salts; 1&#xA0;mM each).

        <title>Purinergic signalling inhibits osmotic swelling of M&#xFC;ller glial cells</title>
        <p>To determine whether extracellular nucleotide metabolism is implicated in the inhibitory effect of ATP on the osmotic swelling of retinal glial cells, we investigated the alterations in size of M&#xFC;ller cell somata in acutely isolated rat retina slices in response to hypotonic stress. As described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], administration of a hypotonic solution (containing 60% of control osmolarity) did not alter the size of M&#xFC;ller cell somata in slices of control retinas, whereas M&#xFC;ller cell somata swelled in the presence of barium ions (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a,b). Similarly, M&#xFC;ller cell somata in postischaemic retinas displayed hypotonic swelling. We recently showed that various purinergic receptor agonists, such as ATP, ADP and adenosine, inhibit osmotic swelling of M&#xFC;ller cell somata and that glutamate also inhibits the swelling via activation of a purinergic signalling cascade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. This signalling cascade is apparently mediated by autocrine mechanisms in M&#xFC;ller cells, as indicated by the lack of effect of the blocker of voltage-gated sodium channels tetrodotoxin on the action of glutamate, ATP and adenosine (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c). The swelling-inhibitory action of glutamate and ATP were blocked by suramin and the inhibitor of P2Y and distinct P2X receptors, PPADS (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>d). The selective P2Y<sub>1</sub> receptor antagonist, MRS2179, prevented the effects of glutamate and ATP but not of adenosine (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>e), whereas the antagonist of adenosine A1 receptors, DPCPX, prevented the effects of all three agonists investigated (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>f). The selective A2a receptor antagonist, CSC, had no effect (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>f). The data suggest that the swelling-inhibitory effects of glutamate and ATP are mediated by activation of P2Y<sub>1</sub> and A1 receptors, and that the activation of A1 receptors occurs downstream from P2Y<sub>1</sub> receptor activation. Apparently, glutamate evokes a consecutive release (or formation) of ATP and adenosine, which successively activates P2Y<sub>1</sub> and A1 receptors in M&#xFC;ller cells.

        <p>Though P2Y<sub>1</sub> receptors are suggested to be preferentially activated by ADP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], there are also studies that show an activation by ATP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. To determine whether extracellular nucleotide metabolism is involved in the swelling-inhibitory effect of glutamate, we tested an inhibitor of ectoapyrases (ARL-67156) and an inhibitor of the ecto-5&#x2032;-nucleotidase (AOPCP). The effect of glutamate was prevented in the presence of ARL-67156 (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>g), suggesting that glutamate evoked a release of ATP from M&#xFC;ller cells, which is extracellularly degraded to ADP/adenosine monophosphate (AMP). On the other hand, AOPCP was largely ineffective in preventing the effect of glutamate (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>G), indicating that the majority of adenosine, which is released after stimulation with glutamate, is not formed by extracellular degradation of AMP. Most of the adenosine, which mediates the glutamate effect, is released by facilitated transport, as indicated by the blocking effect of the antagonist of nucleoside transporters, NBTI (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>h). The data suggest that the swelling-inhibitory effects of glutamate and ATP involve extracellular degradation of ATP to ADP but not of AMP into adenosine.</p>

        <title>ATP-evoked calcium responses</title>
        <p>By rapid degradation, ectonucleotidases are suggested to limit the actions of purinergic receptor agonists. In rat retina M&#xFC;ller cells, intracellular calcium responses can be evoked by various purinergic agonists, such as ATP, ADP and uridine triphosphate (UTP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The predominant P2 receptor subtype that evokes calcium responses in rat M&#xFC;ller cells is the P2Y<sub>1</sub> receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. ATP-evoked calcium responses in rat M&#xFC;ller cells are restricted to the inner half of the cells, i.e. to the processes that traverse the inner plexiform layer, and the cell endfeet at the inner surface of the retina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. To determine whether extracellular nucleotide metabolism modulates purinergic calcium responses, we recorded the calcium responses in the endfeet of M&#xFC;ller cells in acutely isolated retinal wholemounts upon administration of ATP. ATP-evoked calcium responses were observed in M&#xFC;ller cell endfeet that ensheath the ganglion cell bodies, as well as in glial processes that surround retinal vessels (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). As purinergic receptor agonists do not evoke P2X receptor-mediated cation currents in rat M&#xFC;ller cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], the calcium responses are suggested to be evoked by activation of P2Y receptors. Inhibition of ectoapyrases by ARL-67156 caused a significant increase in the ATP-evoked calcium responses in the endfeet of M&#xFC;ller cells (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b,c). It is concluded that the activity of ectonucleotidases regulates the purinergic receptor-mediated calcium responses in M&#xFC;ller glial cells.

        <title>Immunolocalisation of ectonucleotidases</title>
        <p>We stained retinal slices and isolated cells to determine the type of ectonucleotidases expressed by rat M&#xFC;ller cells. In retinal slices, immunoreactivity for NTPDase1 was predominantly localised in large blood vessels within the nerve fibre/ganglion cell layers. In addition, faint staining was observed in the microvessels of the inner nuclear layer (arrows in Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a). Retinal neurons and glial cells, as well as isolated M&#xFC;ller cells (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b), were apparently devoid of immunoreactivity for NTPDase1. M&#xFC;ller cells express NTPDase2, as indicated by the glutamine-synthetase-expressing M&#xFC;ller cell fibres that traverse the inner plexiform layer in retinal slices (filled arrowheads in Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a), and the immunolabeling of isolated M&#xFC;ller cells (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b). The NTPDase2 protein is localised at the whole plasma membrane of M&#xFC;ller cells, including the membranes of the cell endfeet and somata. In addition to M&#xFC;ller cell fibres, NTPDase2 is expressed in both plexiform (synaptic) layers. Immunoreactivity for ENPP1 was largely absent in the inner retina, whereas a slight staining of M&#xFC;ller cell fibres in the outer retina (unfilled arrowheads in Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a) was apparent in some (but not all) retinal slices investigated. M&#xFC;ller cells expressed immunoreactivity for the ecto-5&#x2032;-nucleotidase, in particular, at the inner stem processes (filled arrowheads in Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a) and endfeet, but also at the outer stem processes (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b). In addition, neuronal cell bodies in the ganglion cell and inner nuclear layers may express immunoreactivity for ecto-5&#x2032;-nucleotidase (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a). The data suggest that M&#xFC;ller cells express enzymes for the extracellular degradation of ATP and AMP (NTPDase2 and ecto-5&#x2032;-nucleotidase).

        <p>We found that the inhibition of osmotic M&#xFC;ller cell swelling is mediated by the consecutive activation of P2Y<sub>1</sub> and adenosine A1 receptors (see above). M&#xFC;ller cells express the immunoreactivities for both receptor proteins, which is indicated by the staining of vimentin-positive M&#xFC;ller cell fibres in the inner plexiform layer (filled arrowheads in Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a). In addition, neuronal cell bodies in the inner nuclear and ganglion cell layers apparently express immunoreactivities for P2Y<sub>1</sub> and A1 receptors (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a). Induction of osmotic swelling is a characteristic feature of M&#xFC;ller cells after transient retinal ischaemia (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a,b) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], which can be inhibited by activation of the purinergic signalling cascade described above [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. We stained retinal slices that were obtained 3&#xA0;days after transient retinal ischaemia and found no alteration in the overall localisation of the various enzyme and receptor proteins investigated (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c and not shown). An apparent upregulation of the immunoreactivities in the inner retina [ganglion cell layer (GCL), inner plexiform layer (IPL), inner nuclear layer (INL)] may be caused by the strong decrease in thickness of the inner retinal layers (in particular, of the IPL), which is a typical degeneration pattern of rodent retinas after transient ischemia.</p>

        <title>Ectonucleotidase histochemistry</title>
        <p>To further identify the nature of retinal ectonucleotidases, we analysed retinal tissues of NTPDase1-deficient and wild-type mice using enzyme histochemistry. When ATP was used as substrate, histochemical staining was observed throughout the retinal tissue of both wild-type and knockout mice, with preferential reaction deposit in the outer retina (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a). This suggests that deletion of the NTPDase1 gene has no significant effect on ATPase activity in the retina. Even though the resolution of the enzyme histochemical images is limited due to dispersion of the reaction product, they correspond closely to the immunostaining for NTPDase2 in the rat retina, except that blood vessels are stained in addition (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a). In contrast, when ADP was applied as substrate in wild-type mouse retinas for the same length of time as ATP, staining of the retinal parenchyma was largely abolished. However, strong staining of the vessels was maintained (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b). This pattern of enzyme histochemical staining was very similar to the immunohistochemical staining for NTPDase1 (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a). The enzyme histochemical staining at blood vessels for ADP was abolished in retinas of NTPDase1-deficient mice (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b). No staining of the neural retina was observed when pNPP was applied as a substrate of alkaline phosphatase (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c). The pigment epithelium of both wild-type and knockout mice was strongly stained with all substrates used, suggesting that it is rich in nonspecific phosphatases (alkaline phosphatase). No reaction product was obtained in the absence of substrates (not shown). The data suggest that NTPDase2 (that has a very high preference for ATP as a substrate, ATP to ADP hydrolysis ratio of &#x223C;10:1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]), is the major ATP-degrading ectonucleotidase of the neural retina, where it is associated with M&#xFC;ller cells. NTPDase1 (that equally hydrolyses ATP and ADP) is restricted to blood vessels, and activity of alkaline phosphatase at physiological pH is essentially absent. The lack of enzyme histochemical staining for ecto-ADPase in the NTPDase1 knockout mice (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b) also suggests the absence of NTPDase3 and NTPDase8.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The data presented here suggest that extracellular ATP metabolism is involved in the autocrine regulation of the M&#xFC;ller cell volume in response to osmotic stress. Obviously, there is a multilevel signalling cascade resulting in a prevention of cellular swelling under hypoosmotic stress. Whereas we focused on the role of ectonucleotidases in this study, other aspects of this cascade were described in a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. One of the first steps is the release of glutamate by retinal neurons, which activates metabotropic glutamate receptors on M&#xFC;ller glial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Because a blockade of neuronal activity by tetrodotoxin did not abolish the effect of glutamate, we concluded that neurons are not involved in the cascade downstream from activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors. The pharmacological data presented in Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> suggest the further course of the cascade. Activation of glial metabotropic glutamate receptors evokes a release of ATP, which is assumed to be metabolised to ADP. This assumption is supported by the finding that the inhibitor of ectoapyrases, ARL-67156, prevented the swelling-inhibitory effect of glutamate (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>g). In addition to the unspecific blockers of P2 receptors, suramin and PPADS, the P2Y<sub>1</sub>-specific inhibitor, MRS2179, efficiently suppressed the effects of glutamate and ATP, suggesting that ADP resulting from the action of ectoapyrases activates P2Y<sub>1</sub> receptors on M&#xFC;ller cells. Expression of this receptor subtype on rat M&#xFC;ller cells was demonstrated previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. The further degradation of ADP to AMP and adenosine does not play a decisive role in the cascade because the blocker of ecto-5&#x2032;-nucleotidases, AOPCP, reduced the glutamate effect nonsignificantly. However, adenosine is obviously involved in the cascade. Whereas inhibition of P2Y<sub>1</sub> prevented the effects of glutamate and ATP, it did not alter the action of adenosine. Thus, the effect of adenosine is an event downstream from the activation of glutamate and P2Y<sub>1</sub> receptors. Using two different subtype-specific adenosine receptor blockers, we concluded that the adenosine effect is mediated by activation of A1 receptors (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>f). Because extracellular formation of adenosine is likely to be only a minor source of this nucleoside, the blocker of nucleoside transporters, NBTI, was tested and prevented the effect of glutamate. This suggests that the main part of adenosine is liberated via a transporter. We did not investigate the final steps of the cascade downstream from the activation of A1 receptors. It was concluded from previous data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] that activation of A1 receptors causes the opening of potassium and chloride channels in the M&#xFC;ller cell membrane; thus, the cells extrude potassium and chloride ions, which is associated with a water efflux that prevents swelling under hypoosmotic conditions. Considering the results presented in this study, the extracellular enzymatic degradation of ATP to ADP might play a crucial role in the purinergic cascade involved in the autocrine regulation of the M&#xFC;ller cell volume.</p>
      <p>The activity of ectonucleotidases controls the level of purinergic receptor agonists in the extracellular space. We found that inhibition of ectoapyrases increased the ATP-evoked calcium responses in M&#xFC;ller cell endfeet, suggesting that ectonucleotidases control the availability of extracellular ATP that evokes calcium responses predominantly by activation of P2Y<sub>1</sub> receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The relatively small effect of the ectoapyrase inhibitor may be explained by the possibility that ATP-evoked ATP release from M&#xFC;ller cells may overwhelm the extracellular degradation of ATP. By rapid inactivation of purinergic signalling, ectonucleotidases may regulate the light-evoked purinergic neuron-to-glia signalling in the retina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] and the long-range purinergic calcium signalling in the network of retinal glial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p>
      <p>In a third step of the study, we investigated the expression of enzymes involved in extracellular nucleotide degradation in M&#xFC;ller cells. We found that M&#xFC;ller cells of the rat express immunoreactivities for NTPDase2 and ecto-5&#x2032;-nucleotidase but not for NTPDase1 and only faintly for ENPP1. The expression of ecto-5&#x2032;-nucleotidase is in agreement with previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The expression of  NTPDase2 by M&#xFC;ller cells is a novel finding and is in agreement with data that showed an expression of NTPDase2 (but not NTPDase1) in distinct glial cells of the brain and peripheral nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], as well as with a recent study that described a localisation of ecto-ATPase activity at the electron microscopic level in M&#xFC;ller cell membranes (in addition to synaptic membranes) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. The enzyme histochemical experiments revealed that NTPDase2 is the major ATP-degrading ectonucleotidase of the neural mouse retina, whereas NTPDase1 activity is restricted to blood vessels and alkaline phosphatase is essentially absent at physiological pH. The data also rule out the possibility of a significant expression of NTPDases 3 and 8 in the retinal parenchyma. Our data confirm previous studies describing an exclusive localisation of NTPDase1-like activity and protein to the vasculature of the neural retina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. According to our data, ATP can be rapidly hydrolysed within the retinal parenchyma, whereas (due to the very low ADPase activity of NTPDase2) ADP will be degraded with a considerable delay. The retinal pigment epithelium apparently expresses the activity of nonspecific phosphatases (alkaline phosphatase) and may also express various other extracellular nucleotide-degradative enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].</p>
      <p>The enzyme histochemical data are in agreement with the results of the cell-swelling experiments indicating that ecto-5&#x2032;-nucleotidase activity is not involved in the regulation of M&#xFC;ller cell volume, likely due to the absence of the substrate AMP. The small, nonsignificant effect of the 5&#x2032;-nucleotidase inhibitor (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>g) may reflect the very slow and delayed degradation of ADP to AMP by NTPDase2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. However, further investigations are necessary to confirm the involvement of extracellular nucleotide metabolism in the regulation of M&#xFC;ller cell volume. The nucleotide analogue ARL-67156 has been suggested to inhibit the activities of ectoapyrases in several tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. A recent study using a capillary electrophoresis enzyme assay has shown that ARL-67156 blocks predominantly the activity of recombinant NTPDases1 and 3 and has only a minor effect on the activity of recombinant NTPDase2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Our experimental data imply that NTPDase2 was inhibited by ARL-67156 in retinal slices. It remains to be determined whether the functional state of NTPDase2 (such as its oligomeric state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]) can govern its sensitivity to certain inhibitors or whether ARL-67156 may exert additional effects in intact tissues in situ, such as a blockade of the release of ATP from agonist-stimulated cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>].</p>
      <p>Both extracellular degradation of ATP and the formation of adenosine have been implicated in the suppression of neuronal activity in the retina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. It has been suggested that ATP released from M&#xFC;ller cells is converted extracellularly to adenosine, which in turn activates A1 receptors in a subset of retinal ganglion cells, resulting in cellular hyperpolarisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The present results indicate that both neuronal cells and M&#xFC;ller cells express ecto-5&#x2032;-nucleotidase, that forms adenosine from AMP. On the other hand, we found that only the activity of ecto-ATPases (and not of the ecto-5&#x2032;-nucleotidase) is implicated in the regulation of M&#xFC;ller cell volume and that comparable ecto-ADPase activity (which may deliver AMP as the substrate of ecto-5&#x2032;-nucleotidase) is absent from the retinal parenchyma. The reason for the discrepancy with previously published data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] is unclear and remains to be solved in future investigations. It cannot be ruled out that pharmacological modulation of the glial purinergic signalling may also indirectly alter neuronal activity via alterations of the glial cell volume and, therefore, of the extracellular space volume. Moreover, differences in the local microenvironment and the spatial relationship of ectonucleotidases, purinergic receptors and transporter molecules may explain some of the different findings.</p>
      <p>In summary, we found that NTPDase2 is the major ATP-degradative ectonucleotidase in the parenchyma of rodent retinas, whereas NTPDase1 is expressed solely in retinal vessels. The activity of NTPDase2 is suggested to be implicated in the regulation of the M&#xFC;ller cell volume under osmotic stress conditions. This regulation is likely mediated by extracellular degradation of released ATP and subsequent transporter-mediated release of adenosine. The activity of NTPDase2 is also involved in the regulation of ATP-evoked calcium responses in M&#xFC;ller cells; this may have functional importance for the purinergic neuron-to-glia signalling observed in response to light stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Additional investigations are required to determine the functional roles of NTPDase2 and ecto-5&#x2032;-nucleotidase in the reciprocal signalling between neurons and glia in the retina.</p>
