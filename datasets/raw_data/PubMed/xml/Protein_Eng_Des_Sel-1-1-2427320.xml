      <abstract>
        <p>Bacterial cell-surface display systems coupled with quantitative screening methods offer the potential to expand protein engineering capabilities. To more fully exploit this potential, a unique bacterial surface display scaffold was engineered to display peptides more efficiently from the surface exposed C- and N-termini of a circularly permuted outer membrane protein. Using directed evolution, efficient membrane localization of a circularly permuted OmpX (CPX) display scaffold was rescued, thereby improving the presentation of diverse passenger peptides on the cell surface. Random and targeted mutagenesis directed towards linkers joining the native N- and C-termini of OmpX coupled with screening by FACS yielded an enhanced CPX (eCPX) variant which localized to the outer membrane as efficiently as the non-permuted parent. Interestingly, enhancing substitutions coincided with a C-terminal motif conserved in outer membrane proteins. Surface localization of various passenger peptides and mini-proteins was expedited using eCPX relative to that achieved with the parent scaffold. The new variant also permitted simultaneous display and labeling of distinct peptides on structurally adjacent C- and N-termini, thus enabling display level normalization during library screening and the display of bidentate or dimeric peptides. Consequently, the evolved scaffold, eCPX, expands the range of applications for bacterial display. Finally, this approach provides a route to improve the performance of cell-surface display vectors for protein engineering and design.</p>

Various approaches including phage display (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GZN020C34">Smith, 1985</xref>), mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GZN020C39">Wilson <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>) and DNA display (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GZN020C41">Yonezawa <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>), ribosome display (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GZN020C28">Mattheakis <italic>et al</italic>., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GZN020C21">Hanes and Pluckthun, 1997</xref>), eukaryotic virus display (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GZN020C30">Muller <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GZN020C8">Bupp and Roth, 2002</xref>), yeast display (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GZN020C4">Boder and Wittrup, 1997</xref>) and bacterial display (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GZN020C27">Lu <italic>et al</italic>., 1995</xref>) have been developed to screen diverse molecular repertoires for desired activities. In particular, bacterial display libraries have enabled antibody affinity maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GZN020C14">Daugherty <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>), the discovery of protein-binding peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GZN020C3">Bessette <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>), the isolation of cell-specific ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GZN020C31">Nakajima <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GZN020C12">Dane <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>) and the identification of optimal protease substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GZN020C6">Boulware and Daugherty, 2006</xref>). One of the key advantages of bacterial surface display is the ability to use flow cytometry for quantitative screening of the libraries, allowing for real-time analysis of binding affinity and specificity to optimize the screening process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GZN020C40">Wittrup, 2001</xref>). Additionally, ease of genetic manipulation, high transformation efficiency and rapid growth rate make <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> a well-suited host for display. A broad range of bacterial surface display systems have been developed allowing for insertional or terminally fused peptides and proteins to be displayed on the cell surface. Several outer membrane proteins and cellular appendage proteins have been used to present polypeptides as insertional fusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GZN020C10">Charbit <italic>et al</italic>., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GZN020C36">Taschner <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GZN020C3">Bessette <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>). Ice nucleation protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GZN020C25">Jung <italic>et al</italic>., 1998</xref>), intimins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GZN020C11">Christmann <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>) and LppOmpA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GZN020C16">Francisco <italic>et al</italic>., 1992</xref>) have been used to display proteins on the C-terminus of a transmembrane scaffold while N-terminal display has been accomplished using autotransporters IgA1 protease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GZN020C29">Maurer <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>) and EstA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GZN020C2">Becker <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Recently, a unique bacterial display scaffold was developed that allows for both N- and C-terminal display from a circularly permuted variant of outer membrane protein OmpX (CPX) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GZN020C33">Rice <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). This scaffold enabled display of peptides on both termini, but with reduced efficiency when compared to that obtained using insertions into OmpX. Reduced membrane localization of CPX may result from slower folding rates and reduced stability that has been described previously for circularly permuted proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GZN020C24">Heinemann and Hahn, 1995</xref>). Regardless, reduced display efficiency makes it necessary to employ longer induction times to achieve sufficient display for screening via fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Importantly, inefficient display can also create an undesired selection pressure resulting in growth biases, reduced viability or differing levels of passenger localization on the cell surface. As a result, library screening based on cell fluorescence can favor passengers most efficiently localized to the surface, rather than passengers improved for the properties of interest (e.g. binding affinity).</p><p>A variety of proteins have been circularly permuted to create novel proteins of desired topologies. For instance, Guntas <italic>et al.</italic> coupled a circularly permuted &#x3B2;-lactamase with maltose binding protein to create a switch in which &#x3B2;-lactam hydrolysis activity is increased in the presence of maltose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GZN020C19">Guntas <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). Also, fluorescent proteins have been circularly permuted to create molecular sensors that respond to Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GZN020C1">Baird <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>). In these instances, the point of circular permutation can have important consequences for protein function. Random circular permutations often yield inactive or unfolded variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GZN020C18">Graf and Schachman, 1996</xref>), and those variants retaining activity often fold more slowly and are less stable than the non-permuted parent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GZN020C26">Lindqvist and Schneider, 1997</xref>). With the aim of rescuing the reduced surface localization of CPX relative to the non-permuted OmpX, we used targeted combinatorial mutagenesis and directed evolution to identify CPX variants that would localize passenger peptides to the cell surface with an efficiency equivalent to that of native OmpX. This strategy yielded a more robust display scaffold to present diverse peptides as C- and N-terminal fusions on the surface of bacteria.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Circularly permuted OmpX libraries</title><p>We previously reported a new type of protein scaffold for polypeptide display that allows for both N- and C-termini to be exterior to the cell, using circularly permuted outer membrane protein OmpX (CPX) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GZN020C33">Rice <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). The CPX protein scaffold consists of the native OmpX signal sequence, which is cleaved after translocation; a sequence with an embedded <italic>Sfi</italic>I restriction site (GQSGQ) after which peptides may be inserted; a flexible linking sequence (GGQSGQ); amino acids S54&#x2013;F148 of the mature OmpX; a GGSG linker joining the native C- and N-termini; and finally, amino acids A1&#x2013;S53 of the mature OmpX. To assess the extent of display, a disulfide-constrained streptavidin-binding peptide (SApep) with the amino acid sequence AECHPQGPPCIEGRK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GZN020C17">Giebel <italic>et al</italic>., 1995</xref>) was fused to the N-terminus of CPX, allowing cell labeling using a fluorescently conjugated streptavidin probe and measurement of display levels using cytometry. CPX yielded a reduced level of peptide display when compared to cells displaying the same peptide presented as an insertion within the corresponding region of OmpX (Fig.&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="GZN020F1">1</xref>). The reduced display ability requires longer induction periods to allow for sufficient fluorescence labeling and library screening, thereby causing cell stress that can result in growth biases during library screening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GZN020C13">Daugherty <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>).</p><fig id="GZN020F1" position="float"><label>Fig.&#xA0;1</label><caption><p>Display of a streptavidin-binding peptide using OmpX, CPX and eCPX.

The cells were induced at room temperature for time increments between 0 and 90 min then labeled with 100 nM SA&#x2013;PE.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gzn02001"/></fig><p>The CPX scaffold was constructed using an arbitrarily chosen flexible linker (GGSG) to join the native N- and C-termini. Thus, we reasoned that alternative linkers and point mutations within CPX could enhance the display of peptides on the cell surface. To improve the display characteristics of CPX, various regions of the transmembrane protein were targeted for mutagenesis. An optimized linker region joining the native N- and C-termini was identified by generating and screening four libraries allowing for three (3X), four (4X), five (5X) and six (6X) random residues to be inserted in place of the GGSG linker using the degenerate codon NNK. Each library was screened separately using FACS for clones exhibiting a high level of fluorescence after 50 min of induction, indicating increased display of SApep binding to streptavidin&#x2013;R-phycoerythrin (SA&#x2013;PE). Under these conditions, the parent CPX scaffold yielded display levels only slightly greater than background autofluorescence, making the selection of improved mutants efficient. After sorting, the display level of several clones was measured using cytometry, and their sequences were determined by DNA sequencing (Table&#xA0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="GZN020TB1">I</xref>). Isolated clones exhibited 3- to 15-fold improved display compared to CPX after only a 30 min induction period. The identified linker sequences exhibited a preference for basic residues, and glycine was present at the first position of the linker in 14 of 16 clones characterized. In addition, four of the clones had unintended mutations preceding the native C-terminus, two with the substitution A165V and two others with G166S. Interestingly, these four clones were among the most improved display scaffolds isolated. The average display level of the selected clones from each library increased with increasing linker length, and was highest for 5- and 6-mer linker clones.</p><table-wrap id="GZN020TB1"

display, the amino acid linker that joined the passenger peptide to the N-terminus of the display scaffold was also targeted for mutagenesis and screening for improved variants. A library was created in place of the original linking sequence GGQSGQ by randomizing these six residues. Screening yielded four clones exhibiting a 10-fold improved display when compared with CPX. Sequencing did not reveal a consensus within the target linker region. Instead, clones with enhanced display possessed a non-targeted substitution of either A165V or G166S. Since the randomly selected library members from the initial pool did not possess mutations outside of the intended region, these advantageous substitutions were rare and likely arose from PCR errors. In parallel, a library was generated with random residues at the surface exposed C-terminus of CPX, since native outer membrane proteins (Omps) possess a conserved C-terminal motif thought to aid in Omp membrane insertion or assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GZN020C5">Bos and Tommassen, 2004</xref>). Four clones were isolated from this library that exhibited improved peptide display. Again, these variants did not share consensus in the randomized region, but each carried the spontaneous mutation G166S. These results suggest that the amino acid compositions of the new termini derived from circular permutation have little effect on the rate of assembly and display of CPX, whereas residues A165 and G166 play a key role in proper translocation and insertion of the protein.</p><p>A final library was designed to combine the display-enhancing mutations identified within the most improved clones from the first generation libraries. A six residue linker library was chosen to identify optimal linkers to connect the native N- and C-termini, since longer linkers appeared to improve display (Table&#xA0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="GZN020TB1">I</xref>). After 50 min of induction, individual library members exhibited higher display levels on average when compared with clones with five amino acid linkers (Table&#xA0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="GZN020TB1">I</xref>). The first amino acid of the linker was fixed to glycine since it was highly conserved in the isolated clones. The third and sixth positions were restricted to R/K/S/H/Q/N using the codon MRM, given the increased frequency of these residues at the proposed positions in clones with improved function, and the remaining three positions were fully randomized. Positions A165 and G166, where beneficial substitutions were observed, were also fully randomized. Improved variants were identified using two rounds of MACS followed by two rounds of FACS, sorting clones exhibiting the highest display of the SApep after 30 min of induction. Ten clones were isolated after the final FACS screening (Table&#xA0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="GZN020TB1">I</xref>). All variant scaffolds identified possessed a more bulky hydrophobic residue (I/L/V/F) in place of alanine at position 165, a consensus for serine at position 166 and a high frequency of basic residues Arg and Lys within the linking region. The display enhancing substitutions A165V and G166S are located immediately upstream of the native C-terminus of OmpX (Fig.&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="GZN020F2">2</xref>).</p><fig id="GZN020F2" position="float"><label>Fig.&#xA0;2</label><caption><p>Locations of enhancing mutations within eCPX.

The cell-surface display level of SApep was measured at incremental times after induction of expression for these three scaffolds. This peptide was displayed either at the N-terminus (CPX and eCPX) or as an insertional fusion within the second extracellular loop of OmpX. The level of display was measured before and after 30, 60 and 90 min of induction using flow cytometry (Fig.&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="GZN020F1">1</xref>). The display rate of eCPX was substantially improved relative to that of CPX, and even slightly higher than that of OmpX. After only 30 min of expression, the level of display of eCPX-nSApep was 50-fold above background autofluorescence. Introducing A165L and G166S into OmpX resulted in nearly identical display of SApep relative to that obtained with OmpX (data not shown).</p><p>To determine whether the enhanced display using the eCPX scaffold was a general effect or specific to the streptavidin binding peptide SApep, several unrelated passenger peptides were fused to the N-terminus of CPX and eCPX and their display levels were compared (Fig.&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="GZN020F3">3</xref>). Surprisingly, a disulfide-constrained peptide binding to C-reactive protein (CRPpep) (EWACNDRGFNCQLQR) identified by bacterial display (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GZN020C3">Bessette <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>) displayed with eCPX yielded nearly 50-fold higher florescence labeling than that for CPX, after only 30 min of expression. In fact, the fluorescence of cells displaying CRPpep from CPX could not be distinguished from background (Fig.&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="GZN020F3">3</xref>). Similarly, the T7&#x2022;tag epitope (T7pep) (MASMTGGQQMG) was displayed more efficiently by eCPX than by CPX. A disulfide-constrained 19-mer peptide binding to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) identified previously using phage display (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GZN020C15">Fairbrother <italic>et al</italic>., 1998</xref>) was also displayed over 3-fold more efficiently within eCPX. Additionally, an IgG binding mini-protein [a minimized version of the Z-domain from protein A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GZN020C7">Braisted and Wells, 1996</xref>)] composed of 33-amino acids that form two antiparallel &#x3B1;-helices exhibited a display level roughly 3-fold higher than that from CPX after a 2 h induction period. Finally, P2, a proline-rich peptide (PAPSIDRSTKPPL) known to bind to the C-terminal SH3 domain of Mona (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GZN020C22">Harkiolaki <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>), was expressed as a C-terminal fusion using both CPX and eCPX. Similar to the improvements of display at the N-terminus, the display level after only 30 min of expression of P2 using eCPX was improved by 9-fold compared to display with CPX. Thus, for all peptides investigated, the eCPX scaffold increased display levels when compared to the parental CPX.</p><fig id="GZN020F3" position="float"><label>Fig.&#xA0;3</label><caption><p>Display of various peptides and mini-proteins using eCPX (shaded) and CPX (white) as measured using flow cytometry.

The IgG binding mini-Z helix was selected since it exhibited reduced display in the improved eCPX scaffold. Viability was measured at 30, 60 and 90 min after induction using CFU assays and compared to that for parental strain (MC1061/pBAD33) lacking an expression cassette. Under ordinary display conditions (i.e. induction for less than 60 min), a measurable loss in viability could not be observed. After prolonged induction (90 min), cells expressing the IgG binding minihelix (miniZ) exhibited a 15% loss of viability (data not shown), while cells displaying SApep exhibited viability indistinguishable from that of cells that do not express the scaffold (MC1061/pBAD33).</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Biterminal display using eCPX</title><p>Two distinct peptides were simultaneously displayed on the structurally adjacent N- and C-termini of eCPX. SApep was fused to the N-terminus, and the P2 peptide fused to the C-terminus (eCPX-nSApep-cP2). Labeling with fluorescent probes SA&#x2013;PE (red) and YPet-Mona (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GZN020C32">Nguyen and Daugherty, 2005</xref>) (green) enabled independent detection of each peptide using flow cytometry. To determine the ability of eCPX to simultaneously display these two peptides, cells expressing the biterminal display scaffold were labeled with SA&#x2013;PE only, YPet-Mona only or both probes concurrently. If the peptides bound to their respective receptors independently (i.e. without any steric clashes), there should be no difference between the extent of single color labeling (fluorescence intensity) of the sample labeled with one probe and that labeled with both fluorescent probes simultaneously. However, simultaneous labeling of cells expressing a fusion protein of the form eCPX-nSApep-cP2 with SA&#x2013;PE and YPet-Mona, or with each probe separately yielded differing extents of labeling, consistent with steric interference between these two large fluorescent probes (290 and 34 kDa, respectively). Specifically, the fluorescence of the cells when labeled with only one probe was always greater than the fluorescence in the corresponding channel of the cells when labeled with both probes simultaneously. In an attempt to reduce steric interference, a long flexible linker of the form (GGGS)<sub>5</sub> was inserted between SApep and eCPX, resulting in a total linker length of 26 amino acids causing SApep to be further from the cell surface and thus increasing the distance between the two peptides. Using this long linker, independent labeling of each displayed peptide was improved (Fig.&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="GZN020F4">4</xref>). These results indicate that the use of a long, unstructured linker can increase the accessibility of large proteins to peptides simultaneously displayed at both termini of eCPX, without substantially reducing the level of display.</p><fig id="GZN020F4" position="float"><label>Fig.&#xA0;4</label><caption><p>Flow cytometric measurement of simultaneous N- and C-terminal display (bi-terminal display).

We recently reported a circularly permuted outer membrane protein X (CPX) having the unique characteristic that both C- and N-termini of the scaffold become localized on the bacterial cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GZN020C33">Rice <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). This &#x2018;biterminal&#x2019; scaffold provides a means for expression normalization to improve affinity screening, analogous to yeast display (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GZN020C4">Boder and Wittrup, 1997</xref>), as well as a means to display dimeric peptides. However, the permuted scaffold exhibited reduced surface localization efficiency, precluding presentation of large peptides or the display of two unique peptides simultaneously from structurally adjacent termini. Here, semi-rational design and directed evolution were used to enhance the surface localization efficiency of CPX to improve the display of diverse peptides. To identify CPX scaffold variants with optimal linker sequences for joining the native C- and N-termini, four separate libraries with three, four, five or six random linker amino acids were screened. Improved scaffold variants revealed a preference for longer linkers of five to six residues, a strict consensus for glycine at the first position of the linker, and a high frequency of basic residues in the remaining positions. Unintended substitutions (A165V, G166S) near the native C-terminus of OmpX greatly increased the display level. These substitutions probably arose from rare errors introduced during PCR which were enriched from the large libraries (10<sup>9</sup>). After directed evolution, the final variant with the most improved display (eCPX) carried substitutions A165L and G166S, with a linker sequence of GSKSRR.</p><p>Two substitutions (A165L, G166S) identified to improve surface localization occur at the native C-terminus of OmpX and have a high degree of similarity to the C-termini of outer membrane proteins that lack periplasmic domains (Table&#xA0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="GZN020TB2">II</xref>), even though these Omps share little identity. These results support previous observations that the C-terminal sequence serves an important role in membrane assembly and/or translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GZN020C35">Struyve <italic>et al</italic>., 1991</xref>). The beneficial eCPX substitutions discovered could potentially enhance the ability of chaperones to recognize and assemble this topological variant. Interestingly, the extended C-terminal motif resulting from directed evolution (&#x2212;<sup>L</sup>/<sub>V</sub>XYRFG) is conserved in OmpA homologs which utilize this motif in their last transmembrane &#x3B2;-strand that precedes a C-terminal periplasmic domain (Table&#xA0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="GZN020TB2">II</xref>). Our results suggest that glycine is required to allow the internal, as opposed to terminal, YRF motif to interact with a putative chaperone. The improved linkers also include an increased frequency of charged residues that could serve to increase solubility and decrease aggregation to allow more protein to insert into the membrane.</p><table-wrap id="GZN020TB2" position="float"><label>Table&#xA0;II</label><caption><p>Comparison of bacterial outer membrane proteins&#x2019; C-terminal sequences with eCPX</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Omp ID</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">C-terminal sequence<sup>a</sup></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">eCPX</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">DVGTWILSVGYRFGSKSRRAT&#x2026;</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">NP_992891</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">NIGTWVLGIGYRF</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">YP_624929</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">NPIVTFLSVGYRF</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">YP_156535</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">NPRTVSLSVGYRF</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">YP_341424</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">DPRTVSLTVGYRF</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">ZP_00792472</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">TPVTFNLNVGYRF</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Sequence of last membrane &#x3B2;-strand of OmpA homologs<sup>b</sup></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">EAQ20637</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">LVSVGLIYRFGGKTQAPA</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">EAP54071</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">YWGLELSYRFGTPVAAAA</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">AAN42586</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">LLSLGVSYRFGQGEAAPV</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">NP_992692</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">LLSVGVSYRFGQEDAAAP</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">ZP_00826943</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">MLSVGVSYRFGQDDVVAP</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p><sup>a</sup>Identities between eCPX (with substitutions A165L, G166S) and other bacterial outer membrane protein C-termini.</p></fn><fn><p><sup>b</sup>OmpA homologues with a periplasmic domain following the transmembrane strand exhibit a highly conserved glycine residue following the C-terminal YRF motif of transmembrane proteins.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>The evolution of an efficiently localized biterminal display scaffold (eCPX) provides several important new capabilities for peptide engineering. First, eCPX increased the display rate of various unrelated peptide fusions, on either the N- or C-terminus when compared to that achieved using the parental CPX. Increased display improves library screening efficiency using FACS and promotes the recovery of peptides that are otherwise difficult to display. For example, the display of CRPpep using CPX was only marginally detectable after 30 min of expression, but the same peptide displayed using eCPX provided a fluorescent signal 50-fold above background. If a peptide library displayed on CPX was screened for CRP binding peptides, this sequence and others like it may not have been isolated due to the difficulties in presenting this peptide using CPX. Though, it should be noted that excessive display levels, above that required for screening by FACS, should be avoided to minimize avidity interactions with target proteins. In fact, using eCPX, induction periods as short as 10 min can be sufficient for affinity screening of peptide libraries (unpublished observations). Importantly, quantifying the display level during library screening by labeling of a C-terminal peptide such as P2 allows fine affinity discrimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GZN020C37">VanAntwerp and Wittrup, 2000</xref>); that is, peptides with a high affinity but low display level can be differentiated from peptides with a high display but moderate affinity. Moreover, efficient biterminal display allows for the potential to generate peptide libraries on each terminus where both peptides can bind to distinct epitopes of a target protein, resulting in increased binding affinity and specificity through avidity. Finally, C-terminal display with eCPX should enable new applications such as screening for preferred PDZ C-terminal binding motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GZN020C23">Harris and Lim, 2001</xref>).</p><p>Engineering of the bacterial display scaffold eCPX yielded a circularly permuted transmembrane protein that has both termini presented on the exterior of the cell and inserts into the outer membrane as efficiently as the non-permuted parent. The amino acid sequence used to join the termini played a major role in the proper function of CPX, and two substitutions adjacent to the native C-terminus aided in display of peptides using eCPX. This novel protein scaffold substantially improves the robustness of bacterial surface display via CPX and, when combined with modern cell sorting instrumentation, creates new opportunities for peptide engineering. More generally, similar linker mutagenesis strategies coupled with efficient screening methods should prove useful for optimizing other display scaffolds and circularly permuted proteins.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Bacterial strains, reagents and plasmids</title><p>All experiments were performed with <italic>E</italic>.<italic>coli</italic> strain MC1061 (F- araD139 &#x394;(ara-leu)7696 galE15 galK16 &#x394;(lac)X74 rpsL (StrR) hsdR2 (rK&#x2212; mK+) mcrA mcrB1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GZN020C9">Casadaban and Cohen, 1980</xref>).

Cells were resuspended in ice-cold PBS at approximately 10<sup>7</sup> cells/ml and immediately analyzed and sorted using a FACSAria cytometer with 488 nm excitation. Between 1 and 5% of the most labeled cells were collected and amplified for further rounds of analysis and/or sorting by growing overnight in LB medium containing glucose and Cm. A subset of the sort was plated directly on agar for isolation of single clones. Typically 4&#x2013;10 selected clones were assayed for antigen binding by flow cytometry, and the identity of each peptide insert was determined by DNA sequencing.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Determination of peptide display levels</title><p>To compare the display level of CPX and eCPX as a function of induction time, CPX and eCPX, cells were subcultured 1:50 from overnight stocks into 5 ml LB Cm and grown for 2 h with shaking (250 rpm) at 37&#xB0;C. The cells were then moved to room temperature (22&#xB0;C) to equilibrate and induced with 0.04% (w/v) <sc>l</sc>-arabinose still shaking at 250 rpm. Samples (5 &#xB5;l) were taken prior to induction, 30, 60 and 90 min after induction then added to 50 &#xB5;l of 100 nM SA&#x2013;PE in PBS and incubated on ice for 45 min. The cells were then centrifuged (3000 g, 5 min), supernatant removed and resuspended in 500 &#xB5;l ice cold PBS. Cells were immediately analyzed with a FACSAria using 488 nm excitation and fluorescence data collected at 576 nm.</p><p>To compare the display of various peptides using CPX and eCPX, cultures were started using 50 &#xB5;l of overnight culture in 5 ml LB Cm. Cultures expressing the mini-Z domain, SApep, P2 and T7pep were grown until an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.4 and moved to room temperature (22&#xB0;) to equilibrate and then induced with <sc>l</sc>-arabinose to a final concentration of 0.04% (w/v) for 30 min or 2 h for the mini-Z domain. Cultures expressing the CRPpep and V114 peptides were induced at 37&#xB0;C at an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.4 for 30 min. Induced cells (5 &#xB5;l) were added to 50 &#xB5;l of PBS containing the respective antigens at the following concentrations: 50 nM YPet-Mona, 65 nM biotinylated VEGF, 100 nM biotinylated CRP, 300 nM Alexa labeled human IgG, 100 nM SA&#x2013;PE and 6.7 nM anti-T7&#x2022;tag monoclonal IgG. Samples were labeled on ice for 45 min. Biotinylated samples were spun down at 3000 g for 5 min and the supernatant removed. Cells were resuspended in 50 &#xB5;l of PBS with 10 nM SA&#x2013;PE and put on ice for 45 min. Before cytometric analysis, samples were spun down at 3000 g for 5 min, supernatants removed and 500 &#xB5;l of PBS added to resuspend the cells. Samples were excited at 488 nm; fluorescence data were collected at 576 nm for SA&#x2013;PE labeled samples and 530 nm for Alexa labeled samples and YPet conjugated samples.</p><p>For the dual labeling experiments, cells were subcultured 1:50 from overnight stocks into 5 ml LB Cm and grown for 2 h shaking (250 rpm) at 37&#xB0;C. The cells were then induced with 0.04% (w/v) <sc>l</sc>-arabinose. Cells expressing eCPX-nSApep-cP2 were expressed for 25 min at 37&#xB0;C, and cells expressing eCPX-nSApep-linker-cP2 were expressed for 45 min at 37&#xB0;C. Cells (5 &#xB5;l) were labeled with 50 &#xB5;l of PBS with 100 nM SA&#x2013;PE only, 40 nM Ypet-Mona only or with both probes simultaneously. The negative controls were non-displaying cells labeled with SA&#x2013;PE and Ypet-Mona. The cells were incubated at room temperature for 45 min, centrifuged at 3000 g for 5 min and supernatant removed. The cells were left on ice before resuspension with 500 &#xB5;l ice cold PBS and analyzed using cytometry with 488 nm excitation and measuring emission at 576 and 530 nm.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Supplementary data</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://peds.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gzn020/DC1">Supplementary data are available at <italic>PEDS</italic> online</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Funding</title><p>National Science Foundation CAREER award (BES-0449399) to P.S.D., U.S. Army Research Office&#x2014;Institute for Collaborative Biotechnologies (DAAD19-03-D-0004).</p></sec>
