Contrast discrimination: Second responses reveal the relationship between the mean and variance of visual signals
To explain the relationship between first- and second-response accuracies in a detection experiment, Swets, Tanner, and Birdsall [Swets, J., Tanner, W. P., Jr., & Birdsall, T. G. (1961). Decision processes in perception. Psychological Review, 68, 301–340] proposed that the variance of visual signals increased with their means. However, both a low threshold and intrinsic uncertainty produce similar relationships. I measured the relationship between first- and second-response accuracies for suprathreshold contrast discrimination, which is thought to be unaffected by sensory thresholds and intrinsic uncertainty. The results are consistent with a slowly increasing variance.

Introduction
First applied to psychophysical data by Tanner
and Swets (1954), signal-detection theory (SDT) posits that
all stimuli elicit some sensation. However, due to noise, sensations experienced
in the absence of stimulus can sometimes be more intense than sensations
actually elicited by a stimulus. Crucial evidence for these faint hallucinations
comes from Swets, Tanner, and Birdsall’s
(1961) two-response, four-alternative forced-choice (2R4AFC)
detection experiment, in which observers reported both their first and second
choices for the temporal position of a visual target.1 SDT
predicts that second-guessing should be better than chance, and this is what
Swets et al. found.
1.1
Signal-detection theory
According to SDT (Green & Swets,
1966), each stimulus X, gives rise
to a Gaussian probability-density function (PDF)of sensory intensity x. In its simplest
form, all PDF’s have the same standard deviation, i.e.,
σX = σ,  ∀X.
1.2
Increasing variance
Simple SDT proved incapable of explaining Swets et al.’s (1961) 2R4AFC detection experiment.
Instead, they proposed that sensation variance increased with sensation mean:Increases in the “sigma-to-mean ratio”2
r = dσX/dμX,
produce decreases in both first- and second-response accuracies, but the
second-response accuracies to decrease faster. Swets et al. tried several
values for this ratio and obtained as good fit to their data when
r = 0.25.
1.3
Intrinsic uncertainty
Elsewhere (Solomon, 2007),
Swets et al.’s (1961)
2R4AFC data have been successfully fit with an alternative model,
incorporating intrinsic uncertainty. Intrinsic-uncertainty models posit that
perceived intensity depends on the maximum activity in several independent
sensory mechanisms, only one of which is actually sensitive to the stimulus.
Given a sufficient number M, of these mechanisms, the
variance of their maximum activity will decrease as the intensity of the
stimulus decreases (see Pelli,
1985, for a graphical demonstration of this). Thus, to
some degree, intrinsic uncertainty mimics Swets et al.’s proposal of
increasing variance. With suprathreshold stimuli, the maximum activity
always occurs in the appropriately tuned mechanism, and the others have no
influence on perception.
1.4
Low-threshold theory
At odds with SDT is the idea of a sensory threshold, which weak stimuli
must exceed to be detected. In a detection task, stimuli that do not exceed
the threshold can be selected only when no other stimulus exceeds it, and
the observer is forced to make a choice. Swets
et al. (1961) developed this idea into a
“low-threshold” hybrid of signal-detection and threshold
theories. Unlike other models with this name, Swets et al. claimed theirs
could fit the 2R4AFC results. Elsewhere (Solomon, 2007), I have corroborated this claim, and
shown that the fit is not quite as good as those produced by models
including either intrinsic uncertainty or increasing variance.
1.5
This study
Neither intrinsic uncertainty (Pelli, 1985; Tanner, 1961) nor Swets et al.’s (1961) low-threshold
theory requires sensation variance to increase with sensation mean. These
theories are somewhat special because they are thought to affect the
visibility of only very faint stimuli. Increasing variance, on the other
hand, has implications for suprathreshold contrast discrimination. For this
reason, I decided to conduct a 2R4AFC contrast-discrimination experiment.
The goal was to obtain an estimate of the sigma-to-mean ratio, which would
not be contaminated by intrinsic uncertainty or a low threshold.

Methods
There were five observers: the author (JAS), another psychophysicist who
understood the purposes of the experiment (MJM), two experienced psychophysical
observers who were naïve to the purposes of this experiment (FV and MT) and
one further observer who had no previous laboratory experience (NN). As
described below, NN produced a very high proportion of “finger
errors.” This suggested to us a general unreliability, and no further
analyses were performed on his data.
The Psychophysica (Watson & Solomon,
1997a) software used in these experiments is available at
http://vision.arc.nasa.gov/mathematica/psychophysica.html.
The 23.5-cd/m2 display (a Sony GDM F-520 CRT) was viewed in a
dark room from 1.15 m. Luminances of vertically adjacent
pixels were effectively independent, and could obtain any value between 1.06 and
46 cd/m2. Stimuli were horizontal,
cosine-phase Gabor patterns whose wavelength and spatial spread were
λ = 0.25° and σ = 0.18°, respectively. Stimuli were flashed simultaneously, in
four positions, each marked by four dark spots. The centers of these positions
formed a 5.6° × 5.6° square
centered on fixation (see Fig.
1).
On each trial, three stimuli appeared with a pedestal contrast, which
varied between blocks of 90 trials each. The contrast of the fourth stimulus was
somewhat greater. After each 0.18-s stimulus exposure, observers gave two
responses. The first response indicated which of the four positions the observer
thought most likely to have contained the high-contrast target. The second
responses from JAS and MJM indicated their second choices for the target
position. Following their second responses, JAS and MJM received auditory
feedback indicating which—if either—of their responses was
correct.
The naïve observers were not told that three of the four stimuli would
have the same contrast. They were instructed merely to indicate their choices
for the positions containing the two highest contrasts, in order. This
encouraged them to fully consider their second responses, even when they felt
confident about their first. The naïve observers received no
feedback.
Although I was primarily concerned with suprathreshold contrast
discrimination, I was also eager to replicate Swets
et al.’s (1961) findings at detection threshold. Since
I was therefore committed to measuring both the left and right ends of the
threshold-vs.-contrast function (Nachmias &
Sainsbury, 1974; Fig.
2), I decided to devote a few
extra trials to get the middle as well. (Note: due to limited availability, FV
performed only the critical conditions, i.e., those with supra-threshold
pedestals.)
Table 1 shows the number of trials each observer performed with each
pedestal contrast. In it, and in the discussion below, I use the conventional
decibel scale of contrast energy: if m is the maximum
available contrast, then an x dB stimulus is one that has
a contrast of
m10x/20.
Prior to each trial, the quest procedure (Watson & Pelli, 1983) estimated the performance
threshold ct, i.e., the contrast
increment required for 62%-accurate first responses. This is halfway between
chance performance (25%) and a hypothetical ceiling of 99%.
As a means of more accurately estimating the ceiling, or equivalently, the
frequency of finger errors, a −10 dB increment was used
on one-ninth of the trials. For JAS, the target was given an increment of either
ct − 2 dB or
ct + 2 dB, with equal probability, on the remaining
trials. For the other observers, target increments were either
ct − 2 dB or
ct . This modification allowed
better sampling of their psychometric functions. Finally, to further encourage
the naïve observers to fully consider their second responses, one of the
three alternatives to each of the “obvious” (−10 dB) targets was fixed at −16 dB.

Results
3.1
Psychometric functions
For each observer and each pedestal, first-response accuracies were
maximum-likelihood3
fit with a modified Gaussian distribution.In the preceding expression, c is the
increment (in dB), Ψ1 is the
probability of a correct first response and f is the
PDF defined in Eq. (1). Threshold
ct, and
σ were free parameters, but the frequency
of finger errors δ, was not allowed to vary
with pedestal contrast. These psychometric fits were obtained for purely
descriptive purposes. Unlike some of the fits described below, these were
not driven by any particular model of performance. Best-fitting values for
δ were 0.006, 0.002, 0.048, 0.018 and 0.095
for JAS, MJM, FV, MT and NN, respectively. When debriefed, NN reported a
tendency to respond before the end of a trial.
3.2
Threshold-vs.-contrast functions (first response
only)
Fig. 2 shows how threshold
varies with pedestal contrast. JAS’s and MJM’s thresholds were
similar, and formed the classic “dipper” shaped function. MT did
not suffer as much masking. That is, his thresholds with high-contrast
pedestals were lower than the JAS’s and MJM’s. However, his
detection threshold—obtained with pedestals having zero contrast (or
−∞ dB)—was similar: between −24 and −23 dB. FV’s thresholds with high-contrast pedestals fall
within the range spanned by the other observers’, thus we can be
reasonably confident that these pedestals exceeded her detection threshold,
as they did for the other observers.
3.3
Second-vs.-first-response-accuracy functions:
Detection
Fig. 3 shows how first- and second-response accuracies co-varied
when, as in Swets et al.’s
(1961) experiment, there was no pedestal. Appendix
A contains a full description
of the raw data. Several features of Fig.
3 deserve a detailed description.
The axes differ from those used by Swets et
al. (1961). For the horizontal axes, instead of signal
strength, which may not be a linear function of contrast, I prefer
first-response accuracy Ψ1. For
the vertical axes, Swets et al. used second-response accuracy, divided by
the proportion of first-response errors. However, both first- and
second-response accuracies are subject to measurement error. When one
uncertain statistic is divided by another, the confidence intervals for the
quotient are necessarily very large. To avoid this problem, I get rid of the
denominator and plot simply second-response accuracy
Ψ2.
One argument against this way of plotting the results is that a large
portion of the graph will be wasted because
Ψ2 ⩽ 1 − Ψ1. A dotted line has been
added to each graph to indicate this upper limit for second-response
accuracy. Similarly, Ψ2 ⩽ Ψ1. Of course, given a
finite number of trials, we may find that the frequency of correct second
responses P2 exceeds the frequency
of correct first responses P1, but
only a perverse observer would have a greater
probability of being correct in his or her second
response. Therefore I have added another dotted line to each graph to
indicate this other upper limit for second-response accuracy.
Each point in Fig. 3
represents data collected with a unique target contrast. Several of these
points reflect only a few responses made at the beginning of the experiment,
before the adaptive staircase had converged. We can thus have little
confidence in the likelihood of a correct first or second response with
these targets. To convey this confidence (or lack thereof), I have plotted
95% confidence intervals, both horizontally and vertically, about each
point. These intervals are based on binomial probabilities, calculated from
the range defined by the limits described in the preceding paragraph (see
Appendix B for details).
3.4
Modeling finger errors
SDT can be modified to accommodate finger errors. Let
ψ1 denote the first-response
accuracy without errors. For those trials containing a first-response finger
error, the probability of a correct first response is (1 − ψ1)/3. Thus, if the
finger-error rate is δ, the overall probability
of a correct first response is (1 − δ)ψ1 + δ(1 − ψ1)/3.
To derive the formula for second-response accuracy, it helps to
understand that first-response finger-errors will be incorrect with
probability 1 − [(1 − ψ1)/3] = (2 + ψ1)/3. Without loss of
generality, we may assume that observers correct some proportion
ε of first-response finger errors with
their second response. Thus on these trials, the probability of a correct
second response is ψ1. When
first-response finger-errors are not explicitly corrected, I will assume
that the second response is completely random. On these latter trials, the
second response will be correct with probability [(2 + ψ1)/3]/3 = (2 + ψ1)/9. Thus, on those
trials in which a first-response finger error occurred, the second-response
accuracy should beSecond-response accuracy overall will be (1 − δ)ψ2 + δ
[εψ1 + (1 − ε)(2 + ψ1)/9], where
ψ2 would have been the
second-response accuracy, had there been no first-response finger
errors.
To estimate ε, trials containing an
“obvious” (−10 dB) increment and an
incorrect first response were examined. (Because the highest pedestals had
the potential for masking even these large increments, they were excluded
from this analysis.) On these trials, we may assert that
ψ1 = 1, and we can then solve Eq. (4) for ε.
Solutions were 0.70, 0, 0.58 and 0 for JAS, MJM, FV and MT,
respectively.
3.5
Maximum-likelihood fits
These values of ε were assumed when
calculating the curves in Figs.
3–6. In Fig. 3, the solid black curves represent the
prediction of simple SDT, that is, when r = 0 in Eq. (2). The dashed lines represent the prediction of
high-threshold theory, which ascribes all errors to unlucky guesses rather
than faint hallucinations. (See Swets et al.,
1961 or Solomon,
2007, for derivations of these predictions.)
Maximum-likelihood fits were also obtained for three further
modifications of SDT. They were: (i) increasing variance with power-law
transduction, (ii) intrinsic uncertainty and (iii) low-threshold theory.
Details of these three models can be found in Appendix C, and receiver-operating characteristics
for all three models applied to a yes/no-detection task appear in
Nachmias (1972). The fits
appear as solid green, blue and red curves, respectively, in Fig. 3.
Goodness-of-fit is indicated by the generalized (log) likelihood-ratios
in Table 2. Specifically, these values reflect the maximum log
likelihoods, minus the conventional upper-bound on log likelihood described
in Footnote 3. Note that unlike
some generalized likelihood-ratios (Mood,
Graybill, & Boes, 1974), these cannot be expected to
follow the chi-square distribution because there are so many conditions
(i.e., specific increment contrasts) containing only one or two trials
(Wichmann & Hill,
2001).
Only for JAS, low-threshold theory produced, by far, the best fits of
the three SDT models. In fact, the best-fitting “low” threshold
for JAS was effectively a high threshold, never exceeded by zero-contrast
pedestals. That is why JAS’s red curve in Fig. 3 is visually indistinguishable from the dashed
black line. Since JAS’s results are consistent with a high threshold,
they are inconsistent with the findings and conclusions of Swets et al. (1961).
For the other two observers, the sigma-to-mean ratios of the
best-fitting increasing-variance models were between 0.26 and 0.28; similar
to Swets et al.’s (1961)
estimate of 0.25. Thus, these results can be considered a successful
replication of Swets et al.’s. At the end of this section, I speculate
on why JAS’s results differ.
3.6
Transducer-independent estimates of
r
At detection threshold, as described above, the raw data were simply
fit with a multiplicative-noise/power-law-transducer version of SDT.
However, with suprathreshold pedestals, we cannot be certain what shape the
transducer takes. Increasing-variance models (e.g., Kontsevich, Chen, & Tyler, 2002) use a
simple power-law transducer, but constant-noise models (e.g., Legge & Foley’s, 1980), use a
transducer that is initially expansive, then compressive, as the pedestal
increases. The compressive non-linearity is required to produce masking;
i.e., threshold elevation from high-contrast pedestals.
We do not really have to worry about the form of transducer, because
SDT’s predictions for the relationship between first- and
second-response accuracies are independent of signal transduction
(Solomon, 2007; Swets et al., 1961). We merely need to
quantify how these predictions change with the sigma-to-mean ratio, and find
the values most consistent with the data. This examination of a
transducer-independent facet of contrast-discrimination data is
complementary to attempts at modeling contrast-discrimination data without
putting any constraint on the form of the transducer (Katkov, Tsodyks, & Sagi, 2006a; Katkov, Tsodyks,
& Sagi, 2006b; Klein,
2006).
Transducer-independent estimates of the sigma-to-mean ratio
r were obtained by maximizing the likelihood of
observing second-response accuracies
P2, given the first-response
accuracies P1. A complete
description of this process appears in Appendix D. The best fits were 0.56 for JAS, 0.32 for MJM and
0.31 for MT. These values are illustrated in Fig.
4. All of these fits are comparable to the
maximum-likelihood fits described above.
3.7
Binning accuracy
Fig. 4 is less cluttered than
Fig. 3. It has fewer data
points and no horizontal confidence intervals. Nonetheless, the same data
appear in both figures. For legibility, I have decided to combine data from
increments producing similar first-response accuracies, as determined by the
psychometric functions described above. I have adopted the relatively
arbitrary decision to use 5 dB bin-widths. There is one
visible consequence of this manipulation: a rightward shift for one data
point in JAS’s panel. However, without binning, the suprathreshold
data presented below would be impossible to read.
I have also decided to forgo plotting data from increments producing
both floor (i.e., 0.25) and ceiling (i.e., 1 − δ, see Eq.
(3)) accuracies. Such data are
worthless at discriminating between candidate models. Finally, also for the
sake of legibility, I have also decided to cull data points representing
fewer than 10 trials. Of course, these latter data are not completely
worthless; they have not been excluded from any model fits. A complete
description of the binned data appears in Appendix A.
3.8
Second-vs.-first-response-accuracy functions: Suprathreshold
discrimination
Fig. 5 shows how first- and
second-response accuracies co-varied for the four highest pedestals. (The
binned data are tabulated in Appendix A.) Plotting conventions have been inherited from
Fig. 4.
It should be apparent that the second responses with these
suprathreshold pedestals tend to be more accurate than the second responses
at detection threshold. Using the same procedure as was described for the
detection data (above and in Appendix D), values for the sigma-to-mean ratio
r were found that maximized the likelihood of
observing second-response accuracies
P2, given the first-response
accuracies P1. The best fits were
0.11 for JAS, 0.16 for MJM, 0.21 for FV and 0.09 for MT. These values are
illustrated in Fig. 5.
These values of r are smaller than those
required to fit the detection data. FV’s relatively high value may
have something to do with her relatively high finger-error rate. No
detection data from FV are available for comparison.
Pedestal-by-pedestal estimates of r appear in
Fig. 6. Most of these
estimates remain near or below the value of 0.25, selected by Swets et al. (1961), when neither the
effect of a low threshold nor that of intrinsic uncertainty is considered.
The results from JAS are different; best-fitting values of
r start at 0.56, and decrease to 0 as pedestal
intensity increases.
JAS’s small-pedestal estimates of r are
strangely high. As noted above, they are not incompatible with the notion
that visual noise never exceeds the threshold of visibility in the absence
of a stimulus. Previous attempts to replicate Swets et al.’s (1961) 2R4AFC results have also met
with mixed success. Despite their chronological precedence, Kincaid and Hamilton’s (1959) results
have been described as both successful and unsuccessful replications of
Swets et al.’s (Green & Swets,
1966 and Blackwell,
1963, respectively). As yet, I have not been able to
track down a copy of Kincaid and Hamilton’s publication. One further
attempt to replicate Swets et al. was described by Eijkman and Vendrik (1963). They reported
that second responses for light detection were greater than chance in just
one of three observers.
An alternative interpretation for JAS’s high-threshold-like
performance is that he simply ignored sensory information and selected his
second responses more-or-less randomly. This explanation would be easier to
swallow if all his estimates of r were high. However,
with suprathreshold pedestals, his r is no higher
than that of the other observers. Expectation may have caused JAS to change
his strategy with pedestal intensity, but I have no definitive
answer.
4
Discussion
The most equitable summary of these results is that they are consistent
with a performance-limiting source of noise, which increases slightly with
suprathreshold contrast.
Best estimates for the rate varied from 0.09 to 0.21. I wondered whether
such small sigma-to-mean ratios would be sufficient to model the high
contrast-discrimination thresholds obtained with high-contrast pedestals, or
whether a saturating transducer function for stimulus contrast would also be
necessary. Previous attempts (Kontsevich et al.,
2002; Solomon,
2007) to fit contrast-discrimination data without compressive
transduction have not focused on the minimum necessary sigma-to-mean ratio, but
that ratio can be inferred from the published parameter values.
4.1
Fitting contrast discrimination
In those previous attempts, the standard deviation of visual signals
was allowed to increase as a decelerating power function of the mean. Specifically,(Kontsevich et al. considered only suprathreshold contrast and
thus could set σ0 = 0; Solomon used
σ0 = 1.) Therefore, the sigma-to-mean ratios decreased
as the means increased. From the best-fitting parameter values, I have used
a contrast of 100% to infer the minimum sigma-to-mean ratios required to
explain contrast discrimination without compressive transduction. The
smallest of these ratios was 0.13 (obtained using the parameter values fit
to observer SV with “sustained” stimuli in Kontsevich et al., 2002). Thus it seems
that the sigma-to-mean ratios estimated in the present study may in fact be
able to produce appreciable masking.
Four different models were maximum-likelihood fit to all of
JAS’s, MJM’s and MT’s 2R4AFC data. Details of all four
models appear in Solomon (2007).
One of these models was a four-parameter, non-linear transducer model with
constant Gaussian noise (i.e., where r = 0). This transducer is initially
expansive, then compressive, as the input increases. Foley (1994) obtained good fits to 2AFC
contrast-discrimination thresholds with this model, but we already know this
model will over-estimate second-response accuracies, particularly in a
(zero-pedestal) detection experiment (Solomon,
2007; Swets et al.,
1961).
In the other three models that were fit to JAS’s, MJM’s and
MT’s data, the variance of visual signals was allowed to increase with
the mean. Two of these models have already proven capable of producing
acceptable fits to some of Foley’s
(1994) 2AFC thresholds (see Fig. 13 of Solomon, 2007). In one of these, a
power-law transducer is responsible for the ‘dip’ in the
contrast-discrimination function. In the other, intrinsic uncertainty
produces the dip. The remaining increasing-variance model explored in this
paper uses a low threshold to produce the dip.
Fit details appear in Table
3. Initially, four
parameters were allowed to vary freely in each fit. For JAS and MJM the
best-fitting model was the one with increasing variance model and intrinsic
uncertainty. In general, the fits improved as uncertainty
M, increased. For JAS and MJM, the fits of the
increasing-variance/intrinsic-uncertainty model remained superior when
M was fixed at a value of 10,000. When the
relationship between signal mean and standard deviation was forced to be
linear (i.e., q = 1 in Eq. (5)), the fits of the
increasing-variance/intrinsic-uncertainty model remained superior. They even
remained superior when M was fixed at a value of
1000. Thus, all of JAS and MJM’s data can be satisfyingly summarized
by a relatively simple model, combining increasing variance with intrinsic
uncertainty. Within the context of this model the best-fitting values of
r (regardless of constraints on
M or q) were 0.16 for JAS
and 0.14 for MJM. These values are nearly identical to the
transducer-independent estimates (0.14 for JAS and 0.16 for MJM), described
above.
When MT’s data were fit with a 3-parameter
increasing-variance/intrinsic uncertainty model, the best-fitting values for
the sigma-to-mean ratio and intrinsic uncertainty were
r = 0.11 and
M = 440,
respectively. However, his data are best-fit by the constant-variance,
4-parameter, nonlinear-transducer model (Foley,
1994). Thus, in two out of three cases, the
contrast-discrimination data can be satisfyingly summarized by a 3-parameter
model of intrinsic uncertainty and increasing variance. Compressive
transduction is not required.
4.2
Sensory thresholds for contrast
discrimination
Although “sensory threshold” means different things to
different people (Swets et al.,
1961), it is usually understood to be some sort of
barrier weak stimuli must overcome to be perceived (Swets, 1961). However, it is no less valid
to apply the concept to the task of contrast discrimination, even with large
pedestals. That is, forced-choice errors may occur simply because all the
alternatives appear identical and the observer simply guesses
incorrectly.
Inspection of Fig. 5 should
be sufficient to rule out any “high” sensory threshold for
contrast discrimination. The data shown there are even less similar to the
(dashed) high-threshold prediction than Swets et
al.’s (1961) detection data (not shown). However,
some proportion of correct second responses may indeed have been just lucky
guesses, which is to say my data cannot rule out a “low
threshold” for “suprathreshold” contrast
discrimination.
4.3
Other models
The logic of this study hinges on the assumption that unmasked,
suprathreshold contrast discrimination can be modeled with a single sensory
mechanism. Although this assumption is popular, it is not completely
uncontroversial. Before I describe other possible models, I should first
stress the importance of the word “unmasked.” In a highly
influential paper, Foley (1994)
argued that the mechanism responsible for contrast discrimination was not
immune to the activity in differently tuned mechanisms. By manipulating the
spatial phase, orientation and temporal frequency of masking stimuli,
Foley and Boynton (1994) were
able to probe the interactions between mechanisms responsible for contrast
discrimination. However, when no masks are present, most models (including
all of Foley’s) consider contrast discrimination to be mediated by a
single mechanism or channel; the one best tuned to the target.
There are three notable exceptions. Teo and
Heeger (1994) and Yu, Klein,
and Levi (2004) have developed models with greater
physiological plausibility, in which individual mechanisms have very limited
dynamic ranges. Elsewhere (Watson & Solomon,
1997b) I have argued this type of model is well
approximated by the more popular, single-mechanism model for contrast
discrimination. The two types of model can be considered equivalent when
performance-limiting noise is added after the outputs of multiple mechanisms
are combined.
The third exception was recently proposed by Henning and Wichmann (2007) to account for their finding
that the low-contrast “dip” of threshold-vs.-contrast functions
(e.g., Fig. 2) disappears in the
presence of a notched-noise mask. This result suggests the dip is due to
off-frequency looking. That interpretation may be correct, but I am
obligated to note their results are also consistent with intrinsic
uncertainty, which would attribute a less-pronounced dip to uncertainty
reduction. Indeed, Blackwell
(1998) argued that noise, both within the
detector’s pass band and outside it, could reduce intrinsic
uncertainty and facilitate detection. She also provided psychophysical
evidence for this facilitation.
