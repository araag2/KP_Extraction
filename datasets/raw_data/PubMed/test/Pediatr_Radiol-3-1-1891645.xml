      <abstract>
        <p>The introduction of multidetector row computed tomography (MDCT) scanners has altered the approach to imaging the paediatric thorax. In an environment where the rapid acquisition of CT data allows general hospitals to image children instead of referring them to specialist paediatric centres, it is vital that general radiologists have access to protocols appropriate for paediatric applications. Thus a dramatic reduction in the delivered radiation dose is ensured with optimal contrast bolus delivery and timing, and inappropriate repetition of the scans is avoided. This article focuses on the main principles of volumetric CT imaging that apply generically to all MDCT scanners. We describe the reconstruction techniques for imaging the paediatric thorax and the low-dose protocols used in our institution on a 16-slice detector CT scanner. Examples of the commonest clinical applications are also given.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Imaging of the airways with subsequent 2-D and 3-D reconstructions has significantly improved with the advent of the multidetector row computed tomography (MDCT) scanners. These scanners allow volumetric acquisition of isotropic datasets. As a result, the scanning time is significantly reduced, and large anatomical regions are covered within seconds with optimal intravenous contrast material enhancement. MDCT scanners have significantly improved the image quality as the artefacts resulting from partial volume averaging and motion have been dramatically reduced. Additionally, their fast and user-friendly workstations allow postprocessing of impressive multiplanar 2-D and 3-D reconstructions, which are desirable to clinicians as they can be used for comprehensive presurgical planning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In chest applications, the whole of the tracheobronchial tree can be adequately depicted with a single-breath-hold volume acquisition within 4&#x2013;6&#xA0;s; normal or complex anatomical structures, pathological processes and their anatomical relationships can be precisely imaged [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Finally, on the 16-slice MDCT scanner, by applying the &#x201C;Combiscan&#x201D; protocol (0.75-mm collimated scans after administration of intravenous contrast medium), postprocessing of the original data pool can additionally generate high-resolution images of the chest.</p>

      <title>Technicalities for MDCT of the paediatric airways</title>
      <p>Imaging of the airways and thoracic vessels in infants and children has been significantly affected by the wide spectrum of applications of 16-slice MDCT. The key achievement with MDCT is the increased volume coverage per time unit at high axial resolution, which results in improved temporal resolution. With MDCT, scanning techniques may vary when different collimation is selected: the narrowest collimation is applied when partial volume effect needs to be minimal and the 3-D postprocessing images of optimal quality, e.g. CT angiography (CTA) and cardiac CT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p>
      <sec id="Sec3">
        <title>Preparation of the child: is sedation always needed?</title>
        <p>Due to the faster scanning times possible with MDCT scanners, routine sedation is no longer required. In the neonate, recent feeding usually provides tranquillity while children over 3&#xA0;years of age tend to cooperate after explanation of the procedure through play therapy and verbal reassurance. As a result, CT waiting lists have shortened.</p>

        <title>Radiation dose</title>
        <p>When dealing with children, the issue of performing a low-dose examination is crucial and of the utmost importance. Radiation dose is a significant issue in paediatrics as it is well established that the life-time cancer mortality risk attributable to CT examinations is considerably higher than in adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. As proposed by the ALARA principle, the selection of appropriate scanning parameters focuses on the optimization of the image quality whilst delivering the lowest possible radiation dose and shifting the risk&#x2013;benefit balance towards benefit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p>
        <p>Technical parameters that need to be selected for any scan include: thickness of collimation, tube current, and kilovoltage. The thickness of collimation is the minimum section thickness that can be acquired once the scan is finished and in a 16-row MDCT scanner is usually 1.5&#xA0;mm. Thinner collimation (0.75&#xA0;mm) increases the radiation dose by approximately 30% with our in-house reduced protocol and is applied only in selected cases of vascular abnormalities, visualization of small structures and in cardiac CT (Tables&#xA0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref>). The axial images are reconstructed at 5-mm thickness and archived to the PACS system within our hospital. In recent years we have made efforts to standardize low-dose protocols for the children scanned in our institution, and the currently applied parameters are summarized in the Tables&#xA0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>, <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref> and <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>. Methods adopted to minimize radiation dose in MDCT include: 
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Applying a dose modulation function, where the system samples the patient thickness and adjusts (i.e. reduces) the exposure accordingly when the tube is in the AP/PA position, as patients are narrower in the frontal than in the side-to-side orientation.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Reduction of the kilovoltage to 100&#xA0;kVp when imaging the thorax. Further reduction to 80&#xA0;kVp is possible for CTA, but as resolution of the parenchyma is not ideal this is applied only if lung pathology is unlikely.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Selecting tube collimation of 1.5&#xA0;mm. The 0.75-mm collimation improves spatial resolution but, as already mentioned, increases the radiation dose, and is therefore reserved for CTA or where thin-slice reconstruction is indicated.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Selecting appropriate mAs selection dependent on the patient&#x2019;s weight or cross-sectional diameter.</p></list-item></list><table-wrap id="Tab6"><label>Table&#xA0;6</label><caption><p>Dose comparison for different scanning protocols in a phantom study in our institution</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="3">Weight range (kg)</th><th colspan="10">Effective dose (mSv)</th></tr><tr><th colspan="2">Volume (1.5&#xA0;mm)</th><th colspan="2">Combi (0.75&#xA0;mm)</th><th colspan="2">High-resolution CT</th><th colspan="2">CTA</th><th colspan="2">Chest radiography</th></tr><tr><th>Male</th><th>Female</th><th>Male</th><th>Female</th><th>Male</th><th>Female</th><th>Male</th><th>Female</th><th>AP</th><th>Lateral</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>&lt;15</td><td>0.77</td><td>0.90</td><td>0.9</td><td>1.05</td><td>0.36</td><td>0.42</td><td>1.30</td><td>1.51</td><td>0.00487</td><td>0.00799</td></tr><tr><td>15&#x2013;24</td><td>0.93</td><td>1.09</td><td>1.13</td><td>1.31</td><td>0.36</td><td>0.42</td><td>1.62</td><td>1.89</td><td>0.00874</td><td>0.01086</td></tr><tr><td>25&#x2013;34</td><td>1.34</td><td>1.56</td><td>1.58</td><td>1.84</td><td>0.54</td><td>0.63</td><td>2.24</td><td>2.62</td><td>0.01163</td><td>0.00968</td></tr><tr><td>35&#x2013;44</td><td>2.11</td><td>2.46</td><td>2.48</td><td>2.89</td><td>1.00</td><td>1.17</td><td>2.57</td><td>3.0</td><td>0.01769</td><td>0.01452</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p>
        <p>Unlike the single-slice scanner, an increase or decrease in table feed time on the MDCT scanner only affects the overall scanning time. An increase in table speed results in a concomitant increase in mA and this has no effect on the dose delivered. The tube current is automatically compensated to ensure that the preset effective and total mAs is delivered, i.e. a fast table movement results in an automatic increase in the mA keeping the mAs constant.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="Sec6">
        <title>Anatomical coverage</title>
        <p>For imaging of the paediatric thorax, regular coverage extends from the thoracic inlet to the diaphragm. Greater coverage may be warranted in certain clinical cases, such as an extralobar pulmonary sequestration that may derive its blood supply from the upper abdomen.</p>
        <p>In order to increase spatial resolution, the field of view (FOV) should closely approximate the cross-sectional area of the body part being studied. A large FOV would result in waste of matrix space and partial volume averaging would generate poor quality images [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="Sec7">
        <title>Breathing during scan</title>
        <p>Ideally, scans should be performed during suspended inspiration at total lung capacity, but this is not often possible in younger children. Experience has proved quiet breathing to be more successful than the confusion created over attempts to acquire the scans during suspended inspiration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. When subtle air-trapping due to small airways disease is suspected, a few supplementary expiratory sections may be obtained. If the child is too young to breath-hold, decubitus scans may replace expiratory scans, the dependent lung behaving as the &#x201C;expiratory&#x201D; lung and the nondependent lung behaving as the &#x201C;inspiratory&#x201D; lung [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The acquisition of prone scans is rarely required in older children who may demonstrate hypoventilation changes in the dependent areas of the lungs. General anaesthesia is therefore applied only in a limited number of cases.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="Sec8">
        <title>Contrast medium</title>
        <p>When imaging the airways, intravenous nonionic contrast material is only administered if paratracheal abnormalities, such as vascular rings, anomalous origin of the pulmonary artery, and mediastinal masses are suspected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. &#x201C;Combiscans&#x201D; provide the potential to image equally well the lung parenchyma by using the high-resolution techniques (HR) for reconstruction algorithms and the mediastinal structures by injecting contrast medium. However, since 0.75-mm fine collimation is required, there is an inevitable increase in the radiation dose (Table&#xA0;<xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref>) and its application is limited to cases where lung parenchymal detail is of high importance.</p>
        <p>An intravenous cannula should preferably be placed in situ on the ward so that the child will not associate CT with venepuncture, especially in those in whom subsequent scans may be required. It is ideally inserted via a peripheral vein of the upper or lower limb. Central lines are used for injection in conjunction with clinical agreement and are more desirable as the experience is less unpleasant for the child than having to undergo repeated cannulation. Nonionic contrast medium is administered at a dose of 2.0&#xA0;ml/kg up to a maximum of 50&#xA0;ml via a 20/22G cannula using either a power injector or hand injection (when the cannula is placed in the hand or the wrist). The power injector has the advantage of instilling contrast medium at a constant delivery rate. A flow-rate of 2.0&#xA0;ml/s is used rising to 2.5&#xA0;ml/s for cardiac studies. The delay time between the start of injection and the start of the scan can be empirical and bolus tracking is routinely used in cardiac CT studies (Table&#xA0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).</p>
        <p>In children with complex vascular anatomy, the radiologist should be present for the examination. In those children, low-dose planning scans are performed at a predetermined anatomical level and the injection of contrast medium is triggered by the radiologist. The volumetric scan begins when the contrast medium has reached the relevant preselected vascular structure.</p>
      </sec>
    </sec>
    <sec id="Sec9">
      <title>Postprocessing</title>
      <p>There are four reconstruction displays available for postprocessing of the volumetric data, which are applied accordingly: multiplanar reformation or reconstruction (MPR), 3-D shaded-surface display (SSD), multiprojective volume reconstruction (MPVR) and 3-D volume rendering (VR). In fact, the axial images include all the information about the anatomy of the airways that is provided with 2-D and 3-D reformats. However, postprocessing gives added value to imaging since the axial scans that need to be studied are usually numerous, and oblique structures as well as interfaces and surfaces parallel to the axial plane are poorly demonstrated and sometimes occult.</p>
      <sec id="Sec10">
        <title>Multiplanar reformations</title>
        <p>These provide additional diagnostic information in different planes and are as accurate as the axial scans due to the nature of the isovolumetric acquisition of the data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. MPRs are one-voxel-thick 2-D tomographic sections that can be displayed in coronal, sagittal, or parasagittal planes or in a single tomographic &#x201C;curved&#x201D; plane, along the axis of a structure of interest, e.g. a bronchus or a feeding vessel (Figs.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>, <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>, <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>, <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref> and <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. They are real-time easy-to-reconstruct images, producible as soon as the axial sections are completed. They generally improve our perception of images and give information that although contained in transverse images, is sometimes less effectively displayed. Their diagnostic value is substantial in demonstrating and documenting the presence of small focal lesions, defining the vertical extent of a bronchial stenosis, which may go undiagnosed from the axial source CT images (Figs.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> and <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>), and are invaluable prior to surgical remodelling of vascular rings and the tracheobronchial tree [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. However, to avoid misinterpretations due to partial volume effect, e.g. overestimation of the degree of a stenosis, overlapping and thinner cuts should be applied when processing the raw data. Likewise, when processing curved MPRs, the trace should be centred within the lumen of interest to avoid anatomical distortion.

However, preliminary editing is still necessary and can be time consuming, altering work patterns in CT. In VR, different anatomical tissues are represented by proportional values that are assigned to every voxel and depend on the range of tissue attenuation values in the original data set. Voxels are selected by the probability of belonging to the object of interest; thus they are displayed in different colours or several shades of grey, different transparency or opacity. Transition from the reconstructed surface to the surrounding media is gradual and the depiction of interfaces, like the inner tracheal lining, is supposed to approach their true appearances. Although this 3-D segmentation technique is better and more complicated than the others previously mentioned, some information is lost during processing, so that the axial images are still indispensable for the radiologist to assess extraluminal disease and identify artefacts. Three-dimensional VR-reconstructed images are attractive and appealing to the clinicians as they may better illustrate short focal areas of narrowing, the craniocaudal length of a tracheobronchial stenosis, and complex congenital cardiovascular and tracheobronchial anomalies (Figs.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>, <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>, <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">11</xref>, <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">12</xref>).

        <title>Virtual bronchoscopy</title>
        <p>The inner surface of the air-containing tracheobronchial tree can be displayed with virtual bronchoscopy (VB), which is performed with either polygonal SSD or direct VR. VB is a noninvasive and accurate technique that can provide &#x201C;bronchoscopic&#x201D; views of the central and the peripheral airways (Figs.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and <xref rid="Fig13" ref-type="fig">13</xref>). This technique, like fibreoptic bronchoscopy, is considered supplementary to CT and referral to the axial sections is again valuable in recognizing artefacts and in gaining perception of orientation within the virtual airways. VB uses perspective surface rendering, which takes advantage of the natural contrast between the airway and the surrounding tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The point for viewing is located intraluminally so that external structures do not overlap and editing takes shorter time periods. Sub-millimetre (0.75&#xA0;mm) slice thickness allows deeper penetration and visualization of the bronchial surface down to bronchial diameters of less than 5&#xA0;mm; it is, however, associated with an inevitable increase in radiation dose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].

However, pulmonologists may prefer and relate to these images in conjunction with the axial or the reformatted ones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In practice, VB is of limited value, reserved for cases where bronchoscopy is not applicable (children in whom traditional bronchoscopy presents a risk) or precise navigation is not possible to guide airway interventional procedures, and in emergencies such as infant airway (tracheal) stenosis which cannot be otherwise evaluated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].

However, when compared to fibreoptic bronchoscopy, VB does not allow any therapeutic manoeuvring, is incapable of detecting endoluminal lesions smaller than 2&#x2013;3&#xA0;mm that may go undetected due to the partial volume effect, and provides limited information about mucosal detail (morphology, vascularity and colour), making differentiation between pathological processes and retained secretions difficult [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].

Compression is caused either because of an underlying anomalous anatomical relationship between the tracheobronchial tree and the vascular structures, e.g. a double aortic arch, or is extrinsic, caused by enlarged cardiac or pulmonary vascular structures, e.g. congenital heart disease, dilated pulmonary arteries (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). In children with unexplained respiratory distress, stridor, wheezing, dysphagia and apnoea, a high index of suspicion is required to identify these lesions that cause mechanical airway compression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p>
          <p>A vascular ring is an aortic arch anomaly in which the trachea and the oesophagus are completely surrounded by vascular structures.

          <p>The most common and clinically serious type of vascular ring is the double aortic arch, which represents a persistence of both right and left embryonic fourth arches joining the aortic portion of the truncoaortic sac to their respective dorsal aortae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].

          <title>Foreign body aspiration</title>
          <p>This is one of the most common and potentially life threatening events in children, accounting for 7% of lethal accidents in infants aged 1&#x2013;3&#xA0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. MDCT of the chest for the detection of radiolucent foreign bodies is not the investigation of first choice and not routinely used unless a pulmonary infiltrate that fails to resolve within the normal recovery period of 10&#x2013;14&#xA0;days is present [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. It is vital to remember that actual bronchoscopy should be performed even in cases of low clinical suspicion and no direct history since the risk of overlooking foreign body aspiration may be lethal and may cause long-term pulmonary damage.</p>

          <p>MPRs/VRs with coevaluation of the axial images are the method of choice for staging of hilar or mediastinal neoplasms. They demonstrate interfaces accurately, e.g. the relationship of the lesions to the bronchovascular walls and the presence of mediastinal lymph nodes, since they maintain voxel density values (Figs.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref> and <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). More complex rendering techniques are not usually required [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p>

        <title>Peribronchial air collections</title>
        <p>MPRs/VRs are helpful in demonstrating small extraluminal air collections and leakages of surgical anastomoses, especially in orthotopic lung or heart/lung transplant patients (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>). They can impressively show fistulous paths that may be indiscernible on axial images and affect patient management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Additionally, by correlating with VB the precise location of the leak can be traced prior to actual bronchoscopy.</p>

        <title>Peripheral airways</title>
        <p>MPRs/VRs using MDCT technology have achieved more accurate visualization of the distal airways. The VR technique is applied in thin, overlapping, transverse reconstructed sections using a high-resolution algorithm. This is particularly helpful in the search for bronchiectasis where a single oblique MPR/VR section may include the whole portion of the affected bronchi (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref>). Additionally, when planning the best approach for tissue sampling the relation between peripheral nodules and the afferent bronchus is better appreciated using the MIP/VR sections. Although the applications of conventional HRCT for the evaluation of the peripheral airways are beyond the scope of this review article, the value of HRCT should not be overlooked. When performed individually, HRCT is considerably less of a radiation burden than MDCT (Table&#xA0;<xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref>), but with the standard HRCT protocol, limited slices are performed and the imaging of the mediastinum is insufficient. On the contrary, the Combiscan MDCT protocol with the possibility of HR reconstructions allows detailed parenchymal evaluation of the whole of the chest and simultaneous imaging of the mediastinum; however, there is the disadvantage of extra radiation burden (Table&#xA0;<xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref>).</p>

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p>MDCT with 2-D and 3-D reconstructed imaging has enhanced the applications of CT in imaging of the chest in children. Obtaining high-quality scans should always be attempted at the lowest radiation dose possible. CT and bronchoscopy are supplementary examinations in the diagnostic work-up of children with tracheobronchial pathology. Although 2-D and 3-D rendering techniques are not the first-line diagnostic tools, they significantly reinforce the confidence in a diagnosis even in complex cases. In specific scenarios, they may supply information that is more easily interpreted among the different specialties than conventional axial scans. In the future, virtual tracheobronchial endoscopy is anticipated to be applied for interactive virtual-reality guidance in surgical procedures of the airways.</p>
