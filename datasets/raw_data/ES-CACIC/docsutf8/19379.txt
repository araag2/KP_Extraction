Diffuse outlier time series detection technique for functional magnetic resonance imaging
﻿ We propose a new support vector machine (SVM) based
method that improves the time series classiﬁcation in magnetic resonance
imaging (ﬂ\/IRI). We exploit the robust anisotropic diffusion (RAD) technique to increase the classiﬁcation performance of the one class support
vector machine by taking into account the hypothesis of spatial relationship between active voxels. The proposed method was called Diffuse One
Class Support Vector Machine (DOCSVM). DOCSVM method treats activated voxels as outliers and applies one class support vector machine
to generate an activation map and RAD to include the neighborhood
hypothesis, improving the classiﬁcation and reducing the iteration steps
with respect to RADSPM. We give a brief review of the main methods,
present receiver operating characteristic (ROC) results and conclude suggesting further research alternatives.

1 Introduction

The purpose of MRI is to map areas of increased neuronal activity of the human
brain associated with cognitive or motor tasks. The hemoglobin in the blood is
a natural contrast agent, because it has different magnetic properties depending
of its state of oxygenation. These differences affect the voxel intensity in the
magnetic resonance images  Baseline images are scanned periodically while
the subject is at rest (or in other baseline condition) and activation images are
acquired when the subject is performing a speciﬁc task or receiving a stimulus. A fl\/[RI image can be seen as a set of time series where each time series
corresponds to one voxel in the structural image. Classiﬁcation of time series
is the main subject of brain fMRI data analysis. A number of different techniques have been developed for {MRI data analysis, and can be classiﬁed in
two main categories, model driven [2] [3] [4] and data driven methods [5] Data

CACIC 2010 - XVI CONGRESO ARGENTINO DE CIENCIAS DE LA COMPUTACION 990

driven methods use a method in machine learning or statistics to analyze fMRI
time series while model driven methods assume a model related to the structure
and function of the brain. Support vector machine (SVM) being a data driven
method has been applied to the supervised classiﬁcation of cognitive states [7]
by optimizing a margin and using the kernel trick  One class SVM (OCSVM)
[9][10] has been applied to fl\/[RI unsupervised classiﬁcation [11] [12]. Brain fMRI
time series on most voxels are independent of the experimental stimulus and time
series on only few voxels are related to the experimental stimulus. Time series
related to the stimulus can be considered as outliers and time series not related
to the experimental stimulus as normal data points, satisfying the hypothesis
necessary to apply the OCSVM methods. In order to include the spatial relationship between activated voxels, that assumes that time series on close voxels
have similar state activation correlative or irrelative to the experimental stimulus, new alternatives have been proposed [13] [14][15] [16]. In this work we present
preliminary results of a new technique, DOCSVM, that combines the one class
support vector machine and the RAD to improve the classiﬁcation of fMRI time
series by considering the neighborhood spatial relationship.

The paper is organized as follows, section 2 to 4 cover the fundamental ideas behind OCSVM, RAD and DOCSVM. Section 5 and 6 show experimental results,
conclusions and propose future research work.

2 One-class SVM

There are two main one class classiﬁcation algorithms based on SVM, support
vector data description [9] and one-class SVM [10]. A typical example of interest
of one class classiﬁcation is the outlier detection that attempts to detect uncharacteristic objects from a data set. The one-class SVM estimates a function f that
is positive for a subset of the sample space and negative for the complement.
The algorithm maps the data into a feature space corresponding to the kernel
and separates them from the origin with maximum margin. Different types of
kernels can be used corresponding to nonlinear estimators in the input space.
Consider a given data set

X1,...,XlEX,

where l E N is the number of observations and X is a compact subset of RN.
Let Q5 : X —> 7: be a feature map, that is, a map into an inner product space 7:
such that the inner product in the image of Q5 can be computed by evaluating a
simple kernel.

It can be formulated as an optimization problem.

s.t. (W - 45(X¢)) Z P - Szaék Z 0,

CACIC 2010 - XVI CONGRESO ARGENTINO DE CIENCIAS DE LA COMPUTACION 991

Where 1/ 6 (0,1] is a parameter controlling the penalized term and Si are slack
variables. By solving the optimization problem (1) We obtain W and p and the
decision function is -1 for outliers in the data set and +1 for the rest of the
samples in the data set.

f(X) = SgH(W ' 45(X)) - P) (2)

Introducing Lagrangian rnultipliers ozi, ﬂi Z 0, We obtain

- 2. MW ' 45(X) - P + Si)

Setting the derivatives With respect to the primal variables W, S, p equal to zero
yields

The parameter p can be recovered by exploiting that for any such ozi and the

3 Robust Anisotropic Diffusion

Perona and Malik [17] deﬁned the anisotropic diffusion as

3166, y, 15)

at = div [y(||VI(:c,y,t)||) vI<:c,y.t>1. <4)

using the original image I (33, y,0) : R2 —> lR+ as the initial condition, Where t

is an artiﬁcial tirne parameter and g is an “edge-stopping” function. The right
choice of y can greatly affect the extent to Which discontinuities are preserved.

CACIC 2010 - XVI CONGRESO ARGENTINO DE CIENCIAS DE LA COMPUTACION 992

Perona and Malik suggested two possible edge-stopping functions in their paper
[17]. Black et al. [18] used the robust estimation theory to choose a better edgestopping function, called Tukey’s biweight:

g($):{[1\$]27%é()2 (5)

otherwise

The function g above is the dilated and scaled Version of the original Tukey’s
function, where g(0) = 1 and the local maxima of its “influence function” 1t(:c) =
:cg(:c) is situated at x = 0. The diffusion that uses the Tukey’s function is
called robust anisotropic diffusion (RAD) and this is the edge-stopping function
adopted in this paper.

Perona and Malik [17] discretized spatio-ternporally their anisotropic diffusion
equation (4) as:

I<s.t+ 1) = us. 2:) + [,1] Z y(|VIs.p(t)|)VIs.p(t), <6)

Pens

where I (s,t) is a discretely sarnpled irnage, s denotes the pixel position in a
discrete 2-D or 3-D grid, t Z 0 now denotes discrete time steps, the constant A
determines the rate of diffusion (usually, A = 1), and 775 represents the set of spatial neighbors of pixel s. For 2-D irnages, usually four neighbors are considered:
north, south, west and east, except at the image boundaries. For 3-D irnages, six
Voxels are usually considered: the above-mentioned four plus “up” and “down”
Voxels. The gradient magnitude of a Voxel in a particular direction at iteration
t is approximated by:

VIs.p(t) = 1( at) - H8715), p E 775- (7)

Black et al. [18] suggested to use the “robust scale” deﬁned by:

as = 1.4826MAD(VI) = 1.4826 median;  — rnedian1(||VI||)|], (8)

where MAD is the Median Absolute Deviation.

4 Diffuse One-class SVM

By combining OCSVM and RAD we proposed a new technique that improves
the classiﬁcation of fMRI ternporal series under the Validity of the spatial neighborhood hypothesis.

Let I’ be an fMRI data. First of all, the mean Value is removed from I’,
yielding the rnean-rernoved fMRI I:

1=1'—F (9)

CACIC 2010 - XVI CONGRESO ARGENTINO DE CIENCIAS DE LA COMPUTACION 993

This pre-processing is very important, because structural and functional regions
of the brain do not necessarily match. No structural information should be diffused, but only the activation information. Note that the activation information
is not affected at all by the mean-correction.

Time series on each voxel is taken as a data point. The x¢7j7;,. is the data point
corresponding to the ith row, jth ﬁle and kth slice identifying one particular
time series or data point. The x¢7j7;,. are directly the input into the optimization
problem  The optimal solutions W and p can be obtained by solving the dual
problem and  Then for each xiyjyk. a primal decision value y,<7j7;,. is obtained,

3’myIc = (W ' 45(Xm‘.Ic)) - P (10)
that represents the distance between a point Q5(x¢7j7;,.) and a hyperplane in the
high-dimensional kernel space (W - Q5(x)) — p = 0.

Let us denote the fMRI data at iteration t Z 0 of the diffusion process as
I(s,n,t), where I(s,n,0) is the initial mean-corrected fl\/[RI at spatial voxel
position s and volume 72, and T(s,t) the activation map form by y¢,j,kVi,j, is
where s is particular position i, j, Is.

1. Let t <— 0.

2. Calculate the activation map T(s, 0) by using OCSVM (10).

3. Compute the diffusion coeﬁicients. The diffusion coeﬁicient between a voxel
s and its neighboring voxel p at instant t is:

_q(|VTS,p(t)|), where VTS,p(t) = T( ,t) — T(s,t). (11)

4. Use these coeﬁicients to perform the diffusion in I (s, n, t), yielding the diffused fl\/[R1, I(s, n, t —|— 1), at iteration 15+ 1:

I(s,n,t+1) <—I(s,n,t)+

i, Z g<lvT.,.<t>I>vI.,.<t>, <12)

'77 106775

where VIs7p(n, t) = I(p, n, t) — I(s, n, t).

5. Let t <— 15+ 1 and repeat steps 2 to 5 some predeﬁned number of times or
until the average of diffused values (second term of equation (12)) is below
some predeﬁned threshold.

6. Classify each voxel applying the decision function of equation 

The anisotropic diffusion is controlled by the number of iterations and the scale
parameter of the edge stopping function (5), 0.
5 Experimental Results

In order to test and develop classiﬁcation models in fl\/[RI three main data sets
are commonly used. The ﬁrst model is a completely synthetic one, carefully designed to reproduce real fl\/[RI conditions like signal to noise ratio (SNR), type

CACIC 2010 - XVI CONGRESO ARGENTINO DE CIENCIAS DE LA COMPUTACION 994

of noise and spatial distribution of activated voXels. The second alternative is to
generate artiﬁcial foci of activated voxels in real MRI data. The third possible
data set involves working with real {MRI time series. We present cornparative
results on synthetic data sets known also as synthetic time series, artiﬁcial images or phantorns. These types of experiments provide controlled conditions and
knowledge of the exact activated region location, namely a gold standard. In
order to test and compare results of the proposed method we generate two artiﬁcial images, based on the phantom proposed in [19], with different activation
levels. The 4D {MRI model is formed by 10 X 10 X 3 voXels per volume and 84
volumes. Voxels values were 16000 corrupted by zero-rnean Gaussian noise with
standard deviation 0 = 4000. Active voxels had their values increased by 1000
for phantorn I and 1500 for phantorn II. The MRI experirnent had alternating
blocks of 6 non-active and 6 active volurnes, beginning with non-active volurnes.
Activated volurnes had a 6 X 6 X 3 activated region in the center of the volume, with two non-activated regions of 2 X 2 X 3 voxels each. Fig. 1 depicts one
activated slice of phantorn II, the gold standard and the DOCSVM activation
map.

map produced by DOCSVM (z/ = 0.7,a = 2,15 = 6)

In the experiments on the two synthetic datasets, the principal parameters
of the algorithms were set as follows. The radial basis function was chosen as
the kernel function for the OCSVM and 1/ = 0.7. RADSPM and DOCSVM are
sensible to the scale pararneter selection [20], beginning with 0 = as we adjust
0 using ROC curves as a gauging procedure as suggested in [21].

We have obtained cornparative results of four different methods by using the
the well-known Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) analysis [21] [22] [23].
Let TP, FN, FP and TN be respectively the number of true positives, false
negatives, false positives and true negatives obtained by comparing the ideal
classiﬁcation (gold standard) and the results obtained by each of the evaluated
rnethods. Then, the True Positive Fraction (TPF) and the False Positive Fraction
(FPF) are deﬁned as:

Figure 2 depicts correlation’s SPM, OCSVM’s, RADSPM’s and DOCSVM’s
ROC curves. Each point of a ROC curve is obtained by solving equation (13) for
a speciﬁc threshold Value. Table 1 presents some performance metrics of the four
ROC curves, all of them demonstrating the improved performance of DOCSVM
and RADSPM compared to the non-spatial oriented rnethods considered in the
experiments. The area under the curve and the distance deep from the principal
diagonal to the optimal operating point (OOP)(the point of the curve rnost distant from the principal diagonal), are superior for DOCSVM With less diffusion
iteration steps With respect to the results of RADSPM.

6 Conclusions and Future Work

In this paper We have presented a new SVM based technique named DOCSVM
taking into account the spatial relationship activation hypothesis. This technique
improves fMRI time series classiﬁcation. We compared this method to OCSVM,
correlation analysis and RADSPM. Experimental results using ROC curves on
synthetic data sets have shown promising results for DOCSVM. The proposed
method treats activated voxels as outliers and applies OCSVM to generate an
activation map and RAD to include the neighborhood hypothesis, improving
the classiﬁcation and reducing the iteration steps with respect to RADSPM.
The obtained results of DOCSVM are preliminary. Further research involves
improving the probabilistic model used to create the artiﬁcial images considering
the noise distribution and the signal to noise ratio in order to approximate the
complex and noisy fMRI signal structure. Extensive tests on real fMRI and
artiﬁcial data must be done in order to adjust parameters and extend our results
to different real experiment paradigms.
