Knowledge management in distributed software development a systematic review
﻿ Software development is characterized as a knowledge intensive 
activity.  Particularly, Distributed Software Development (DSD) is an approach 
that demands more attention for coordination and communication among 
members of distributed team, due to regional, cultural and infrastructure 
differences. Knowledge has being, increasingly, seen as the most important 
strategic resource in organizations. So, the management of this knowledge is 
critical to organizational success. Knowledge Management (KM) is a set of 
processes directed at creating, capturing, storing, sharing, apply, and reuse  of 
knowledge, which are useful to decision making. The purpose of this paper is to 
present a systematic review carried out to identify the processes, techniques, 
methods, practices and/or tools adopted for Knowledge Management in 
Distributed Software Development. With this systematic review some 
interesting points for research were identified.  
Keywords: Knowledge Management; Distributed Software Development; 
DSD; Cooperative Development; Systematic Review. 
1   Introduction 
The Distributed Software Development (DSD) is an approach for software 
development that comes to meet of globalization need, such as: increase of 
productivity; quality improvement and costs reduction. It added to software 
development challenges concerned to cultural differences, geographic dispersion, 
coordination and control, communication and team spirit, which intensified some 
problems found during the project lifecycle [1], [2]. 
Software development is, by itself, characterized as a knowledge intensive activity, 
including for example the knowledge about processes, products, skills of different 
professionals involved. The interaction and information sharing among teams 
members are important parts of the process of knowledge construction in DSD 
context. Furthermore, knowledge has being seen as the most important strategic 
resource in organizations. 
Knowledge Management postulates that organizations must deal knowledge as a 
factor of richness. It is a discipline that promotes in an integrated way, management 
and sharing of all information assets that a company owns. This information can be 
found in a database, source code, documents, procedures, as well as on people, 
857
through their experiences and skills. So, when software development is considered, it 
is essential to maintain the knowledge available for fast and easy access for whose 
that needs it in the organization or in a supply chain. 
In this sense, knowledge management has been increasingly used in companies to 
organize, strategically, the knowledge of employees and external knowledge, which 
are essential for business success. This paper describes a systematic review that was 
carried out in order to identify the processes, techniques, methods, practices and / or 
the tools adopted to promote knowledge management in distributed software 
development environment. 
The text is structured into more three sections beyond this introduction. The second 
section describes the methodology adopted. The third section presents the results and 
discussion. Finally, the fourth section, presents the final considerations. 
2   Methodology 
A.   A Systematic Review 
Systematic review is a planned and structured process that aims at finding work and 
research related to a specific research question or concern. One of its applications is 
best known in the evaluation, interpretation and synthesis of available data on given 
technology, treatment or procedure, allowing the identification of problems and the 
formulation of a new scenario or solutions for this study [4]. 
 
B.   Method adopted 
The procedure applied to this review was adapted from the model presented in 
Kitchenham [4]. Firstly the research purpose was defined. Based on that, the research 
questions, which contain criteria for inclusion and exclusion of papers were defined. 
After that, the database to be used to carry out searches, the language, the publication 
year were also defined. 
For data collection, were considered keywords related to issues of research and 
based on them, query sequence were formulated. All papers found were archived and 
cataloged with the help of a program called JabRef. After registration of the papers, 
began the pre-selection stage of them, which consisted of rapid reading of titles, 
keywords and abstracts. With this, was evaluated the adequacy of them regarding of 
search criteria established. After the pre-selection stage, was performed a complete 
reading of the papers approved in the first stage. Then the synthesis and interpretation 
of data were performed. 
 
C.   Research Goals 
This review aimed to: 
• Identify the processes, techniques, methods, practices and / or tools adopted 
for knowledge management in distributed software development. 
• Observe the results of the practices of Knowledge Management in 
Distributed Software Development. 
 
D.   Research Questions 
Considering the goals above mentioned, questions containing appropriated criteria for 
inclusion and/or exclusion of papers were elaborated. These are: 
858
Question 1: What processes, techniques, methods, practices and / or tools are 
adopted to promote knowledge management in distributed software development? 
Question 2: What are the benefits of the knowledge management in distributed 
software development? 
Question 3: What kinds of difficulties, limitations and / or problems occur in the 
use of knowledge management for distributed software development? 
 
E.   Search Strategy 
• Sources: Electronic indexed database (IEEE, ACM, Compendex and 
ScienceDirect). 
• Language: English, once it is the internationally accepted language for 
scientific papers. 
• Types of documents: conference proceedings, journal papers, books / book 
chapters, thesis and dissertation chapters and review reports. 
• Year of publication: published papers in the period from 2000 to 2013. 
 
G.   Query strings 
The keywords were determined considering the terms "distributed software 
development" and "knowledge management".  The query string was create using 
logical operators AND and OR. 
 (“Distributed Software Development” OR “Global Software Development” OR 
“Geographically Distributed Development” OR “Collaborative Development” OR “Distributed 
Development” OR “Distributed Software Project” OR “Global Software Engineering” OR 
“Globally Distributed Work” OR “Distributed Teams” OR “Global Software Teams” OR 
“Virtual Teams”) AND (“Knowledge Management” OR "Knowledge Acquisition" OR 
"Knowledge Achievement" OR "Knowledge Retention" OR "Knowledge Application" OR 
"Knowledge Sharing" OR "Knowledge Use" OR "Knowledge Integration” OR "Knowledge 
Discovery" OR "Knowledge Organizational" OR "Knowledge Transference”). 
 
H.   Inclusion criteria (ICi) 
To address the research questions, the following criteria were defined: 
[IC1] Processes, techniques, methods, practices and / or tools adopted to promote 
knowledge management in distributed software development; 
[IC2] Scenarios and cases in which knowledge management has been applied to the 
distributed software development; 
[IC3] Difficulties or problems found to implement knowledge management in distributed 
software development. 
 
I.   Exclusion criteria (ECi) 
To address the research questions, the following criteria were defined: 
[EC1] Processes, techniques, methods, practices and / or tools adopted to promote 
knowledge management those are not adequate for distributed software development 
context; 
[EC2] Scenarios and cases in which knowledge management has not been applied for 
distributed software development; 
[EC3]  Difficulties or problems found in the implementation of knowledge management not 
related to distributed software development;  
[EC4] Papers written in language different from English; 
[EC5] Papers that were not available to perform the complete reading. 
 
859
J.   Preliminary Process 
In the preliminary process of selection, the query string, composed by keywords and 
synonymous terms (Knowledge Management and Distributed Software 
Development), was submitted to indexed databases and search engines. Later, the 
title, abstract and keywords of found papers were read.  Each paper selected was 
analyzed and was approved for complete reading if presented results that were 
relevant to research carried out.  If there was not relevant data for research in 
question, the paper was not approved for complete reading.   
 
K.   Final Selection Process 
At the end of selection process, the papers that had been approved in preliminary 
phase were undergone to a complete reading. So, when the subject (approach, tools, 
experiment) dealt was not related to research goal, the paper was discarded. At the 
end of the complete reading, if the paper was approved, the reader was responsible for 
summarize the data.   
 
L.   Quality assessment of the papers (Qi) 
The assessment goal was not to classify the papers according to a total quality score. 
So, was not assigned any score. Thus to classify them the binary scale was used, 
considering the criteria defined by Dyba et al [5] as following: 
[Q1]  Is there a clear statement of the research goals? 
[Q2]  Is there an adequate description of the context in which the research was carried out? 
[Q3]   Does the research design is appropriate to address the aims established for that?  
[Q4]  Was there a control group with which could compare the results? 
[Q5]  Does the data analysis is sufficiently rigorous? 
[Q6]  Does the article is based on research or experiments? 
[Q7]  Are there results which can be applied in practical situations?  
[Q8]  Is there a clear statement of findings? 
[Q9]  Are there artifacts generated as result from the  search presented at the paper? 
[Q10] Does article presents some model for promoting the Knowledge Management? 
3   Results and Discussion

Strategy for knowledge

SP 14, SP 25 2 papers 
 
Among the papers that presented models, 70% of these present a software for 
automation of them. The automation of the proposed model demonstrates its 
applicability and also facilitates its adoption. 
Regarding the representation of knowledge was observed that most of them use 
resources such as templates and tags. Only one of the selected papers used ontology to 
promote knowledge management in distributed development. The ontology was used 
as a tool for standardization and quantification of the information and helped on 
externalization of knowledge. It is noteworthy that the benefits of using ontologies are 
related with the facility to carry out inferences and allow the reuse of 
information/knowledge. OntoDiSEN, is an ontology for distributed software 
development domain, which can be extended to include matters related to knowledge 
management [6]. 
The concept of reuse was also used as a justification of knowledge management, 
aiming at the classification of information and subsequent use of them. 
E-mail, wiki, video conferencing and telephone are resources used for knowledge 
dissemination. However, it is emphasized that the use of appropriate tools to support 
knowledge dissemination is essential to ensure the knowledge availability on site and 
on time for correct decision making. In case of distributed software development the 
problems related to communication are exacerbated by socio-cultural and temporal 
questions. 
861
The flow of knowledge was considered in 6 papers and demonstrated the 
importance of communication for development and maintenance of knowledge as 
intellectual capital owned by the company. 
Regarding the use of repositories, the papers analyzed highlighted how important is 
to store the information concerned to the project, process, distributed teams and 
artifacts generated during whole development of distributed software. The papers also 
showed the importance of using of appropriated techniques to capture and  represent 
of knowledge so that it can be processed and thus generate new knowledge. 
In respect to communication standards, the papers presented a set of best practices, 
such as: knowing the sender to establish trust, standardization of documents to be 
sent, among others. Thus, adopting these best practices together with the 
formalization and use of automated tools could be a strategy to support knowledge 
reuse.  
Studies point that culture has a great impact on promoting of Knowledge 
Management in DSD, since the information provided informally has higher 
interactivity than those obtained from tools and repositories. Based on this, it is 
emphasized that when dealing with distributed team, knowledge management cannot 
be disassociated from practices that promote the trust among team members.  Another 
analysis was also performed to evaluate the year of paper publication. Fig. 2 shows 
2010 as the year in which were found the most relevant publications presented in this 
review and also that there was no relevant publication in 2000 and 2001.

As for assessing the quality of work, the questions set out in methodology of the 
systematic review were answered. The results on Table 2, show the quantity of papers 
that met the particular issue of quality in the occurrence column.

It can be observed that 50% of papers present results of knowledge management 
practices in distributed software development environment. Only 6 papers stand out 
practical experiments containing a control group for comparison and validation of 
hypotheses. Among these papers that present practices, most quote communication as 
a difficulty, thus emphasizing the need to establish the sense of trust in the sender of 
the message for the effective acquisition and internalization of knowledge reported. 
863
4   Final Considerations 
Regarding the studies analyzed, we observed that they address somehow, techniques, 
practices, tools and methods to promote knowledge management in distributed 
software development. Most studies showed knowledge representations and 
definitions for creating models of knowledge management, since there is specific 
knowledge in a DSD. Other studies showed the use of data repository to capture and 
maintain knowledge in the organization. To meet the challenge of communication in 
geographically dispersed teams, the use of e-mail, phone and web conferencing 
practices were more suitable. 
This paper aimed to present the results achieved through a systematic review, 
listing the works that dealt with processes, techniques, methods, and practices to 
promote KM tools in DSD. Based on the analysis contained in Section III, we can 
highlight some points that deserve further study: 
• appropriate mechanisms for disseminating knowledge; 
• explore data mining techniques, observing socio cultural aspects in DSD, 
from data stored in the repository in order to extract interesting  knowledge; 
• mechanisms to capture and represent data, aiming to generate knowledge. 
One idea that has been explored by our research group is to proceed with the 
extension of OntoDiSEN [6]; 
• integrate knowledge management practices to approaches for distributed 
software development, such as proposed in [7]. It is important emphasize 
how artifacts can be used to disseminate knowledge in distributed teams [8]; 
• explore the context information as way for dissemination of knowledge. 
Therefore, the results from this systematic review, evidence that there are 
challenges in knowledge management for DSD.  So, the integration of several areas 
for standardization and reuse in software, storage and dissemination of information 
and communication are points that could be explored. Furthermore, the results show 
the need for tools that promote knowledge management in DSD to enable the 
socialization of information. For each one of these points we can foresee an 
interesting point for future works to be developed as research.
